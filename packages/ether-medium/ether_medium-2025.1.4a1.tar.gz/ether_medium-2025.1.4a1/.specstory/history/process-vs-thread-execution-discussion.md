Let's run this in its own process instead of thread.

I notice this is a `uv.lock` file, which is a lockfile format used by the `uv` Python package manager. This appears to be a complete lockfile containing package dependency information. However, I don't see any code that needs editing - this is a generated lockfile that contains package metadata and shouldn't be manually edited.

Could you clarify what changes you'd like to make to this file? Or perhaps you meant to share a different file that contains code you want to modify to run in a process instead of a thread?
