What does the '*' mean here?

_**Assistant**_

In the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) socket binding context, `*` means "bind to all available network interfaces" or "listen on all available network interfaces". 

Let's break this down:

- When you bind a socket with `tcp://*:port`, the socket will accept connections on the specified port from any available network interface on the machine
- This includes localhost (127.0.0.1), the machine's LAN IP address, and any other network interfaces present

For example, if your computer has:
- A loopback interface (127.0.0.1)
- An Ethernet interface (192.168.1.100)
- A WiFi interface (192.168.1.101)

Using `tcp://*:5555` would make the socket listen on all of these interfaces on port 5555.

If you wanted to restrict the binding to a specific interface, you could replace the `*` with an IP address, like:
- `tcp://127.0.0.1:5555` (only localhost)
- `tcp://192.168.1.100:5555` (only Ethernet interface)

This is commonly used in server-side bindings where you want the service to be accessible from any network interface on the machine.
