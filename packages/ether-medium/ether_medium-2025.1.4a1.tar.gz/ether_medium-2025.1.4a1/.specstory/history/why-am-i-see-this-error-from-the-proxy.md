Why am I see this error from the proxy?

The error you're seeing is occurring in the `__del__` method of the `_ProxyManager` class when Python is cleaning up during program termination. The issue is that during interpreter shutdown, some built-in functions like `open` may no longer be available when `__del__` is called.

Let's fix this by modifying the `_proxy.py` file to handle cleanup more gracefully:

```python:src/ether/_proxy.py
# ... existing code ...

class _ProxyManager:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    def stop_proxy(self):
        """Stop proxy if we started it and we're in the creating process"""
        try:
            if self._proxy_process is not None and self._parent_pid == os.getpid():
                self._logger.info("Stopping proxy process")

                self._proxy_process.join(timeout=5)
                if self._proxy_process.is_alive():
                    self._proxy_process.terminate()
                self._proxy_process = None
                
                # Force context termination to clear all buffers
                self._logger.debug("Terminating ZMQ context")
                zmq.Context.instance().term()
                
                # Handle PID file cleanup more safely
                if os.path.exists(self._pid_file):
                    try:
                        with open(self._pid_file, 'r') as f:
                            pid = int(f.read())
                            try:
                                os.kill(pid, signal.SIGTERM)
                            except (OSError, ProcessLookupError):
                                pass  # Process might already be gone
                        os.remove(self._pid_file)
                    except (ValueError, OSError, IOError):
                        pass  # Ignore any errors during cleanup
        except Exception:
            # Ignore any errors during shutdown
            pass

    def __del__(self):
        try:
            self.stop_proxy()
        except Exception:
            # Ignore any errors during deletion
            pass

# Create singleton instance
proxy_manager = _ProxyManager()

# Uncomment and use this instead of __del__ for more reliable cleanup
atexit.register(lambda: proxy_manager.stop_proxy())
```

The changes include:

1. Added try/except blocks around the cleanup code to handle errors gracefully
2. Added error handling for process termination
3. Made the PID file cleanup more robust
4. Added a try/except block in `__del__`
5. Uncommented and enabled the `atexit` handler which is a more reliable way to handle cleanup than `__del__`

These changes should prevent the error from appearing while still ensuring proper cleanup. The `atexit` handler is particularly important as it runs before interpreter shutdown, when all built-ins are still available.
