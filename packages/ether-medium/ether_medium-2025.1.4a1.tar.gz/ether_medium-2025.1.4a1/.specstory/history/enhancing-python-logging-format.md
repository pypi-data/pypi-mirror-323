## Enhancing Python Logging Format (1/16/2025, 11:39:22 AM)

Is it possible to add the file and line of code to the logging format?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can add the filename and line number to the logging format by using the `%(filename)s` and `%(lineno)d` format specifiers. Here's how to modify the formatter:

```python:src/ether/utils.py
    formatter = logging.Formatter(
        '%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(filename)s:%(lineno)d - %(message)s',
        datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
    )
```

This will add the filename and line number before the message, separated by a colon. For example, the log output might look like:
```
2024-03-20 10:15:30.123 - myapp - INFO - script.py:42 - Some log message
```

You can also use `%(pathname)s` for the full path instead of just the filename if you prefer that.

No, just the filename is fine, but can we add the Class and method name?

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, you can add the class and function/method name using `%(funcName)s` for the function name. To include the class name, you'll need to use `%(pathname)s`. Here's the modified formatter:

```python:src/ether/utils.py
    formatter = logging.Formatter(
        '%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(filename)s:%(funcName)s:%(lineno)d - %(message)s',
        datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
    )
```

This will produce output like:
```
2024-03-20 10:15:30.123 - myapp - INFO - script.py:MyClass.my_method:42 - Some log message
```

Note: For class methods, `%(funcName)s` will show as `ClassName.method_name`. If you're using decorators or some special method types, the function name might not always be exactly what you expect, but it generally works well for standard methods and functions.
