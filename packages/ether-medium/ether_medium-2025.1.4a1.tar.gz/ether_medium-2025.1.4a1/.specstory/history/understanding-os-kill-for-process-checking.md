The line `os.kill(pid, 0)` is a way to check if a process exists without actually sending it a signal to terminate. It's a common Unix/Linux idiom for process existence checking.

Here's how it works:

1. When you call `os.kill()` with a signal number of 0, no actual signal is sent to the process
2. Instead, the system just performs error checking:
   - If the process exists and you have permission to send it signals, the call succeeds (returns None)
   - If the process doesn't exist, it raises an `OSError`
   - If the process exists but you don't have permission, it raises a `PermissionError`

In this specific context, the code is checking if the proxy process identified by the PID stored in the PID file is still running. If `os.kill(pid, 0)` succeeds, the code returns early because it means the proxy is already running. If it raises an `OSError`, the code removes the stale PID file and continues to start a new proxy process.

This is a more reliable way to check process existence compared to just checking if the PID file exists, as the PID file might be left behind if the process crashed or was forcefully terminated.
