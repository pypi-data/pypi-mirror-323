# downloader-exporter

A prometheus exporter for qBitorrent/Transmission/Deluge. Get metrics from multiple servers and offers them in a prometheus format.


## How to use it

You can install this exporter with the following command:

```bash
pip3 install downloader-exporter
```

Then you can run it with

```
downloader-exporter -c CONFIG_FILE_PATH -p 9000
```

Another option is run it in a docker container.

```
docker run -d -v CONFIG_FILE_PATH:/config/config.yml -e EXPORTER_PORT=9000 -p 9000:9000 leishi1313/downloader-exporter
```
Add this to your prometheus.yml
```
  - job_name: "downloader_exporter"
    static_configs:
        - targets: ['yourdownloaderexporter:port']
```

### The exporter is running too slow

#### Use params

You can use params to collector metrics from one or more downloaders as you chose, for example
```
curl localhost:9000/metrics?name[]=qb1
```
Will only fetch downloader named qb1 in your config.

Then you can use [multi-target-exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/multi-target-exporter/) to config your prometheus.

#### Use --multi

You can use an options to expose multiple ports for each downloader you're watching. Then the exporter will open a range of ports starting from the one you set, each port for each downloader

With command line
```
downloader-exporter -c CONFIG_FILE_PATH -p 9000 --multi true
```

With docker
```
docker run -d -v CONFIG_FILE_PATH:/config/config.yml -e EXPORTER_PORT=9000 -e USE_MULTI_PORTS=true -p 9000-9010:9000-9010 leishi1313/downloader-exporter
```

### How to connect to Deluge

Deluge uses three ports for different operations:

1. Incoming Port: Used by other torrent clients to connect to your instance.
2. WebUI Port: Used to access the Deluge WebUI.
3. **Daemon Port**: The one we need, this port is typically 58846, but you can confirm it by navigating to `Preferences -> Daemon` in the Deluge WebUI.

To connect to the daemon, you'll need the daemon username and password. These credentials are stored in a file named `auth`, located in Deluge's config folder. You can view the file's contents using the following command:

```shell
root@f80e4787ec08: cat /config/auth
localclient:011cc7842dc8ad50f165ab712a8ef110e06fd7c0:10
```

In this example you can use `localclient` as user and `011cc7842dc8ad50f165ab712a8ef110e06fd7c0` as password to connect.
It's always different on your machine and you can add your choice of user/password by following the existing pattern.

# Config file

The config file is compatible with [autoremove-torrents](https://github.com/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents), you can also refer to `example.yml` to see how to write it.

# Grafana

You can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to host your own stack of `Grafana`/`Prometheus`/`downloader-exporter`.

Simplely clone this project, add or edit `config.yml`, then start the docker-compose:

```shell
cp example.yml config.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

Use `localhost:3000` and `admin`/`admin` to access the dashboard.

First you will need to add a data source, select `Prometheus` with URL `prometheus:9090`, Then go and add a new dashboard with ID `15006` (use `22677` for English version), the dashboard should look like
