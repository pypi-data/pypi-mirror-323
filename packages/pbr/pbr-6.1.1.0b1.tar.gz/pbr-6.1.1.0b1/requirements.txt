# PBR always implicitly depended on setuptools which until python3.12
# was included by default in python installations. Since python3.12
# setuptools is not included so we add an explicit dependency on
# setuptools here.
# DO NOT add any other dependencies as PBR is meant to be minimalist
# to avoid problems with bootstrapping build environments.
