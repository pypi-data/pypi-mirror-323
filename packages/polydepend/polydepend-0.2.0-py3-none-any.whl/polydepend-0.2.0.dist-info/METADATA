# PolyDepend

*A Cross-Language Dependency Resolver and Manager*

---
# Overview

PolyDepend is a powerful and extensible tool designed to resolve dependency issues for projects written in various programming languages. It analyzes your project files, resolves version conflicts, and installs the required dependencies seamlessly.

Whether you are working with Python, JavaScript, Java, or other languages, PolyDepend simplifies dependency management, making it easier to maintain multi-language projects and monorepos.

---

# Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Handles dependencies for Python, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Go, Rust, and more.
- **Dependency Conflict Resolution**: Automatically detects and resolves version conflicts.
- **Offline Mode**: Caches dependencies for offline installation.
- **Dependency Visualization**: Generates dependency graphs to identify conflicts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Comes with both CLI and GUI options.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add support for new languages using plugins.

# Installation

Install PolyDepend using pip:
```bash
    pip install polydepend
```

# Usage
# CLI Usage
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
    polydepend <path_to_your_project>
```

Example:
```bash
    polydepend /path/to/my/python/project
```
---

# GUI Usage
Launch the graphical interface:
```bash
    python -m polydepend.gui
```
1. Select your project folder.
2. Analyze dependencies.
3. Resolve conflicts and install.

# Development
Clone the repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Simacoder/polydepend.git
    cd polydepend
```

Install development dependencies:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run tests:
```bash
    pytest tests/
```

# Extending PolyDepend
To add support for a new language:

- Create a new analyzer module in src/analyzers/.
- Implement the analyze_dependencies() function for the new language.
- Register the new analyzer in the resolver.
- 
Example for Ruby:
```bash
def analyze_ruby_dependencies(project_path):
    """Parse Gemfile for dependencies."""
    # Your implementation here
```
