Uptainer is a Python CLI that automates tool updates, ensuring consistency and reliability in your GitOps-driven infrastructure.

The tool offers a straightforward interface for specifying the repository from which to read and write, as well as the regular expression to constrain version increments. The tool will then handle the remaining automation tasks.
