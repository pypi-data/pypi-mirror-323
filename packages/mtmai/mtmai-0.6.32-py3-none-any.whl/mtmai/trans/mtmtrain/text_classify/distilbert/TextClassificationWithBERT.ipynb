    "The Large Language Models (LLM) like BERT (published in 2018 [1]) have been a huge progress in the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP). LLM help solving many NLP tasks with state-of-the-art performance.\n",
    "In this article we will show with a practical example how text classification can be performed using BERT, in the two main frameworks used for Deep Learning: TensorFlow and PyTorch. For the BERT part we will use the HuggingFace libraries.\n",
    "In the first part of this article, we will remind (briefly) what is a Large Language Model, how we can use it for Transfer Learning, and how it can be fine-tuned for a specific task like Classification. Then we will prepare the dataset, develop the models and train them in both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. Finally we will compare the two frameworks.\n",

In the present article, we re-use a part of what we have written at that time, so there will be some overlapping."

   "source": [
    "The publication of the model BERT in 2018 [1] was a revolution in the NLP world, since Large Language Models like BERT achieve state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks. To show how BERT can be used in practice, we develop an example of Text Classification. In these cases, we say that BERT, which contains linguistic capabilities and world knowledge from its numerous sources it was trained with (Wikipedia, books, ...), is used for Transfer Learning, while the Classification exercise we perform is called Fine-Tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Fine-Tuning\" does not mean that we adjust the BERT model. We use BERT as it is,and add a \"head\" on top of BERT. BERT is used to \"encode\" some properties of a text into a vector (or tensor). The Classification exercise consists then of a Classification of these vectors. The Classification of these encoded values into vectors becomes a classical classification Machine Learning problem, which can be done either with a classical approach (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, ...) or with a Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise, we will not work with BERT directly, but with DistilBERT, which is a simplified model (having only half of BERT's parameters) which mimicks the behaviour of BERT. DistilBERT's performance is very close to BERT's performance (and sometimes even better), despite having only half of the parameters! For more details about this approach you can read [2]. In the present article, we will use the word BERT most of the time, even if we use DistilBERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a Text Classification model using BERT we can apply two (slightly) different strategies. As mentioned above, BERT is used to encode texts into a vector. The classification model we built on BERT consists of classifying these vectors using ML algorithms. So we can either:\n",
    "- Apply BERT to the texts as a pre-processing steps, then build a ML model that classifies these vectors\n",
    "- Build a model which starts with BERT (where we freeze the parameters when training the model), then build on top of BERT a layer that classifies these vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the first method is that we need to pass the text (training and test data) only once through BERT, and not for each epoch at training, reducing significantly the training time. The advantage of the second method is that we do not need to build an additional step to the pipeline, since the end-to-end (from text to classification) is provided by the tokenizer (see below in the developments what this is) and the model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For pedagogical purpose, we will go with the second approach. In a real case, the choice of the approach would depend on the use of the model. If we need to regularly train the model I would favor the first approach. If the model has to be trained only once I would go for the second approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the DistilBERT model from the Python library transformers, which is provided by the company Hugging Face."

This makes the overall prediction more robust. When using the model for inference (prediction), the dropout layers are ignored and the output is re-scaled accordingly. Note that this is one of the reasons why we have to tell the model whether it is in training or in evaluation mode.\n",

But all these three object types can also be instantiated as objects, and then customized.\n",

We also observe that the accuracy increases with the epochs, and the trianing and validation accuracies are close to each other, meaning there seems to be no overfitting.

    "When preparing the data, TensorFlow has proven to be very versatile, as it is possible to use NumPy arrays, which is a format in which many datasets are available, and is very easy to manipulate. TensorFlow also has its own tensors (TensorFlow tensors), and its own datasets formats (which we have not covered in this article, you can find details in [ref], chapter [ref]). PyTorch, to the best of our knowledge, requires the use of its own PyTorch tensors, datasets, and dataloaders. This makes the preparation of datasets more rigorous, but this definitely comes at the costs of less flexibility.\n",

    "For training, TensorFlow offers a high level framework (Keras), which makes training especially easy, using a \"fit\" function similar to what all Machine Learning engineers know from the scikit learn framework. With TensorFlow it is possible to go to a lower level when training, however not at a level PyTorch offers. In PyTorch, training has to be prepared yourself, at a low level where even the loops over epochs and batches need be defined. The various steps of training (forward, backward, adjustment of parameters) is done in a very granular manner. When training in PyTorch, we get the feeling that \"we know what is happening\", which is very positive. But unfortunately, there is no high level framework available in PyTorch (as far as we know), which would allow to quickly experiment new models."
