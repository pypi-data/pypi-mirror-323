# ðŸ’» Webex Builder

This script will build a webex device for a user either as a primary device or as a Shared Call Appearance. 

An email and alternate user id is set, then an optional feature pack can be assigned for billing. 

Next, Integrated IMP is enabled in the user services (This is needed for the integration with Cisco). Furthermore, the device is built to the device profile you set using `device_type` parameter and then added to the user either as a primary device or SCA.

{% hint style="warning" %}

Before running ensure your user has correct licensing for Shared Call Appearance if secondary device. Furthermore, make sure all prerequisites for the group to have webex users have been taken.
```
