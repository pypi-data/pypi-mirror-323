Due to the data structure of the module before version 14.0.2.0.0,
there is no way to link partial settlements created before this version
of the module to a specific payment or account move, and therefore to the
new data structure existing after the changes.

A "best effort" migration of previous data could be developed to
ensure a smoother transition between versions.
