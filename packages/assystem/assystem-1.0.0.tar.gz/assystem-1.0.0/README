ASSystem (a.k.a. "ASS") is a small one-file key-value database

Python support is limited, but it should be fine for most usecases

=== INSTALLATION ===

```
pip install assystem
```

=== USAGE ===

```
import assystem
a = assystem.ASS("db.ass")
a.set(b"key", b"value")
print(a.get(b"key"))
a.remove(b"key")
```
