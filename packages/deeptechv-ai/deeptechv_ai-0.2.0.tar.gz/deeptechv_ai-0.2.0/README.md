Usage
Command Line Interface (CLI)
After installation, you can use the toolkit via the command line:

bash
Copy
deeptechv_ai
This will execute the default command, which prints a welcome message.

Python API
You can also use the toolkit programmatically in your Python projects. Here's an example:

python
Copy
from deeptechv_ai import DeepseekClient

# Initialize the client
client = DeepseekClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Make a request to Deepseek's API
response = client.generate_text(prompt="Explain AI in simple terms.")
print(response)
Configuration
To use the toolkit, you need to set your Deepseek API key. You can do this in one of the following ways:

Environment Variable:
Set the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable:

bash
Copy
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_api_key"
Programmatically:
Pass the API key directly when initializing the client:

python
Copy
client = DeepseekClient(api_key="your_api_key")
Features
OpenAI-Compatible Client: Easily interact with Deepseek's API using a familiar interface.

CLI Support: Run commands directly from the terminal.

Extensible: Add custom functionality to suit your needs.
