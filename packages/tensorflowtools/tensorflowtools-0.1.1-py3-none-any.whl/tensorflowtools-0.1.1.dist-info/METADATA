           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<summary>download_model_from_huggingface(username, repository, model_id)</summary>


This downloads a model named tf_model.h5 or tf_model.keras from huggingface to the tensorflowtools data directory. It can be used with the load_from_hf_cache function in the kerastools submodule


##### Example


    import tensorflowtools
    tensorflowtools.hftools.download_model_from_huggingface("sharktide", "recyclebot0", "sharktide/recyclebot0")
    model = tensorflowtools.kerastools.load_from_hf_cache("sharktide", "recyclebot0", "tf_model.h5")
    model.summary


</details>


<details>
<summary>clear_model_cache()</summary>


This clears the model cache; all downloaded models and configuration files will be deleted


##### Example


    import tensorflowtools
    tensorflowtools.hftools.download_model_from_huggingface("sharktide", "recyclebot0", "sharktide/recyclebot0")
    model = tensorflowtools.kerastools.load_from_hf_cache("sharktide", "recyclebot0", "tf_model.h5")
    model.summary
    tensorflowtools.hftools.clear_model_cache()
    try:
        model = tensorflowtools.kerastools.load_from_hf_cache("sharktide", "recyclebot0", "tf_model.h5")
    except:
        print("It worked!")

<details>
<summary>load_from_hf_cache(username, repository, filename)</summary>


This loads a model using tf.keras.models.load_model() from tensorflowtools's cache. Use with the hftools submodule to download a model to the cache.

Warning: This does not currently work in google colab. We are working to resolve this issue.


##### Example


    import tensorflowtools
    tensorflowtools.hftools.download_model_from_huggingface("sharktide", "recyclebot0", "sharktide/recyclebot0")
    model = tensorflowtools.kerastools.load_from_hf_cache("sharktide", "recyclebot0", "tf_model.h5")
    model.summary
</details>


<details>
<summary>default_image_augmentation(rate)</summary>


This returns a sequential model of some basic image augmentation. The rate float is the amount of augmentation that should be applied. An average rate is 0.2.


##### Example


    import tensorflowtools


    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tensorflowtools.kerastools.default_image_augmentation(0.2),
        #rest of your layers here
    ])


</details>


<details>
<summary>basic_ffnn(input_dim, output_dim, loss, compile_model=True)</summary>


This returns a very basic fully connected neural network. The input dimensions are the dimensions for the first dense layer, the output dimensions are the dimensions for the last dense layer, the loss is the loss function to be used if compile_model is set to true. If you aren't planning to compile the model, still pick as loss function.


##### Example


    # Example usage of the basic FFNN
    from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
    from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical


    # Load and preprocess data
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
    x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28*28) / 255.0
    x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28*28) / 255.0
    y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
    y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)


    # Create and compile the model
    model = basic_ffnn(input_dim=28*28, output_dim=10, 'categorical_crossentropy')


    # Train the model
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)


</details>


<details>
<summary>basic_cnn(input_shape, num_classes, loss, compile_model=True)</summary>


This returns a basic convolutional neural network for image classification. The input dimensions are the dimensions for the first convolutional layer, the number of classes is used in the last dense layer. the actication of the last layer will automatically be switched between sigmoid and softmax depending on the type of classification.


##### Example


    # Example usage of the basic CNN
    from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
    from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical


    # Load and preprocess data
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
    x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) / 255.0
    x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) / 255.0
    y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
    y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)


    # Create and compile the model
    model = basic_cnn(input_shape=(28, 28, 1), num_classes=10, 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy')


    # Train the model
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)


</details>


<details>

Gives basic starter architecture for a lstm model.
:param input_shape: Input shape for the first lstm layer
:param output_dim: Output dimensions of final dense.
:param loss: Loss function
:param activation: The activation function for the last dense layer.
:param compile_model: Optionally compiles the model.
:return: Generated lstm model with optional compilation.


##### Example


    # Example usage of the basic LSTM model
    from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
    from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences


    # Load and preprocess data
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data()
    x_train = pad_sequences(x_train, maxlen=500)
    x_test = pad_sequences(x_test, maxlen=500)


    # Create and compile the model
    model = basic_lstm(input_shape=(500, ), output_dim=1, 'categorical_crossentropy', 'softmax')


    # Train the model
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64)
