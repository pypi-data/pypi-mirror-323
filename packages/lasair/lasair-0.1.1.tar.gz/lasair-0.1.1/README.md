# lasair_api
Client package for Lasair

NAME
    lasair - Lasair API

DESCRIPTION
    This class enables programmatic access to the Lasair database and Sherlock service, 
    as described at http://lasair-ztf.lsst.ac.uk/api/.
    
    Args:
        token (string): The Calls are throttled by the lasair server, by use of an 
        'authorization token', as described in the api documentation above. 
        There is a free token listed there, but it is throttled at 10 calls per hour. 
        Once a user has an account at the Lasair webserver, they can get their own token
        allowing 100 calls per hour, or request to be a power user, with infinite usage.
    
        cache (string): Results can be cached on a local filesystem, by providing 
        the name of a writable directory. If the same calls are made repeatedly, 
        this will be much more efficient.
