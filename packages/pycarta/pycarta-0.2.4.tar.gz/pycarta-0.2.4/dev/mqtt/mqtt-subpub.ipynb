    "# MQTT Subscribe-Publish Testing Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the functionality of `publish` and `subscribe` using:\n",
    "- Several different broker types:\n",
    "    - Local Mosquitto MQTT broker (without credentials)\n",
    "    - Remote AIMPF MQTT broker (with credentials)\n",
    "- The `publish` decorator to send messages in both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** modes\n",
    "    - `@publish(\"test\")`\n",
    "    - `@async_publish(\"test\")`\n",
    "- The `subscribe` decorator to process messages in both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** modes\n",
    "    - `@subscribe(\"test\")`\n",
    "    - `@async_subscribe(\"test\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- **General**\n",
    "    - Ensure `pycarta` is installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`) from the root directory of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Mosquitto MQTT broker**\n",
    "    - Ensure Mosquitto is installed and running:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        brew install mosquitto\n",
    "        mosquitto\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - A mosquitto subscriber can be set up as follows to listen to topic `test`:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        mosquitto_sub -t test\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - A mosquitto publisher can publish `$YOUR_MESSAGE` to topic `test` as follows:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        mosquitto_pub -t test -m $YOUR_MESSAGE\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote AIMPF MQTT broker**\n",
    "    - A set of credentials available including:\n",
    "        - broker_address (not in the certificate requirement, but will be needed for connection)\n",
    "        - ca_certificate\n",
    "        - private_key\n",
    "        - certificate\n",
    "    - Basic information about the broker, e.g., broker address, port, etc.\n",
    "    - (Optional, but highly recommended) A Carta account for credential CRUD operations \n",
    "        - You have already uploaded MQTT credentials to your chosen `tag`. Please check the Jupyter Notebook named `credential-crud.ipynb` for more details.\n",
    "        - Environment variables set for authentication for your account (e.g., `CARTA_CHEN_USERNAME`, `CARTA_CHEN_PASSWORD`).\n"
