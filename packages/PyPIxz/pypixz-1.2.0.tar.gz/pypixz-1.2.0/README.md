# PyPIxz

**PyPIxz** is a simple, modern, and easy-to-use solution for managing your
Python dependencies.

```python
import pypixz

# Install dependencies listed in a requirements.txt file
pypixz.install_requirements("requirements.txt", enable_logging=False)

# Retrieve information from a module.
result = pypixz.get_module_info("pypixz", version="1.1.2")
print(result)
```

Output result of `get_module_info` command :

```console
{'name': 'pypixz', 'description': 'PyPIxz is a simple, modern, and easy-to-use
solution for managing your Python dependencies.', 'latest_version': '1.1.2',
'project_url': 'https://pypi.org/project/PyPIxz/', 'pypi_url':
'https://pypi.org/project/PyPIxz/', 'specific_version_exists': True}
```

> [!TIP]
> If you need a much lighter version for specific needs you can use our [LITE version](https://github.com/YourLabXYZ/PyPIxz-LITE).

> [!WARNING]
> We recommend using PyPIxz LITE at the very beginning of your program to
> avoid running into the `ModuleNotFoundError` error.

PyPIxz allows you to easily and simply manage the dependencies necessary for your Python program while maintaining a certain security. It is designed to be compatible with other internal modules such as **logging** for log management while ensuring compatibility with any Python environment from version 3.8.
