## Usage

Here are some simple examples of how to use kalle:

- **Simple example**: `kalle "hi"`
- **No conversation history**: `kalle -x "What's the capital of California?"`
- **Custom conversation**: `kalle -c partyplanning "Lets plan a party."`
- **Using a different profile**: `kalle -P ollama "Hello, world!"`

***For more examples, check out the [usage guide](docs/usage.md).***

## Features

**Profiles**: connect to any number of different endppints and language models

- Local and self hosted models are supported via llama.cpp and Ollama and TabbyAPI
- Vendor managed models can be accessed via Anthropic, OpenAI, Grok and Google VertexAI APIs

**Conversations**: kalle supports multiple conversations, so you can have focused discussions on specific topics.

- Create a new conversation: `kalle -c my_conversation "Hello, world!"`
- List all conversations: `kalle -l`
- Have a different conversation: `kalle -c my_other_conversation "Hello, other conversation!"`

**Piped input**: information can be piped into kalle on the command line.

- Reference command output: `git diff | kalle -x "Review this git diff, determine why the changes were made and generated a well formed git commit comment." `

**Document references**: kalle can incorporate documents from your local filesystem or web pages into your conversations.

- Reference a local file: `kalle -f "Tell me about this document: file://test.pdf"`
- Reference a web page: `kalle -f "What is this webpage about: https://www.fsf.org"`

**Tools**: tools can be invoked to accomplish various tasks

- Create a file: `kalle -t "Create a file containing the text 'Hello World'."`
- Send a desktop notification: `kalle -t "Send a desktop notification with a haiku about turtles."`

**Constrained generation**: (limited to TabbyAPI currently) constrain generation with regex and json-schema

- Constrain with regex: `kalle -S $(date "+%s") -x -R "HEADS|TAILS" "Flip a coin and tell me if its heads or tails."`
- Constrain with json-schema: `kalle -x -J schema.json -f "Reformat this content into json: file://data.md"`

**Patterns**: create building blocks of agentic functionality

- Combine a set of system prompt tempalte, prompt template, constrainer and profile
- Pipe output from one pattern to the input of another
- Create streamlined workflows
