    Essentially, an organization is a group of agents.
    When a problem comes to be solved, it will come
    to the organization, the organization will
    then delegate the problem to the specific

    Note(arthur):
    An organization is maybe a group of sectors? Than each sector
    is a group of agents. Each sector can have a leader, and the
    organization can have a leader. The organization leader
    can delegate tasks to the sector leaders, and the sector
    leaders can delegate tasks to the sector agents. I think
    that will be a really solid structure.

    Each department/element of the organization should be completely
    documentated and filled with metadata. This will help the subtasks
    to be delegated to the correct agents. Because there will be a lot
    of metadata to choose the correct agent to solve the problem.
    I think, in this case, there is no problem the metadata to be
    Mapping[str, Any] because it can be any metadata that the
    organization leader thinks that is important to choose the
    correct agent to solve the problem. Actually, this parameter should be
    called extra_metadata, because the most common metadatas should be instance defined attributes
