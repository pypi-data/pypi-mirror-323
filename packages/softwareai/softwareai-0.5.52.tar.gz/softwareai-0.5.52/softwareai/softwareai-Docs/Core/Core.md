# Import SoftwareAI Functions

## Overview
This module provides various functions to interact with different components of the software AI ecosystem, such as agents, libraries, keys, and more. These functions help in managing and interacting with these components effectively.

## Installation
The required libraries can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install ``
```

## Usage
To use the functions in this module, simply import them from the appropriate submodules:
```python
from softwareai.Functions._init_functions_ import *
from softwareai.Functions_Submit_Outputs._init_submit_outputs_ import _init_output_
from .._init_agents_ import *
from .._init_libs_ import *
from .._init_keys_ import *
```

#### 2. Function Definitions
##### 2.1 `create_or_auth_vectorstoreadvanced`
```markdown
## create_or_auth_vectorstoreadvanced
This function checks if a user's vectorstore advanced settings exist in the database.

Parameters:
- key : str
    The unique identifier for the user.
- UseVectorstoreToGenerateFiles : bool
    The boolean indicating whether vectorstore advanced features should be used.

Returns:
--------
str
    A string representing the value of the 'UseVectorstoreToGenerateFiles' setting.

Raises:
-------
Exception
    If an error occurs during the process.

Example:
--------
>>> create_or_auth_vectorstoreadvanced('user123', True)
