Thu, July 18th at 4:17 pm OPENAI launched the GPT-4o mini, 60% cheaper than other models... This made my big project viable, a software organization/company formed by artificial intelligence, all the code will be open and free interpretation, however business applications created with Qt5 from SoftwareAI will be sold and made available at site
