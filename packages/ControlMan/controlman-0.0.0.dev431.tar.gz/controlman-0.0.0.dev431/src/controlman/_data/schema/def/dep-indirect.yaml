title: Indirect Dependency
description: |
  Declaration of an indirect dependency.
  
  An indirect dependency is an application, package, or module
  that is directly used by the project in some way,
  but does not need to be explicitly installed
  because it is already installed as a dependency of another project dependency.
  An example are [Sphinx's built-in extensions](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html#built-in-extensions)
  that are included in Sphinx, but need to be declared in the `conf.py` file to be used.
