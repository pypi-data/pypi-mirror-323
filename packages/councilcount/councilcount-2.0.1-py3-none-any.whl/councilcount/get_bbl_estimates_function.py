def get_bbl_estimates(year=None):
    
    """
    Produces a dataframe containing BBL-level population estimates for a specified year.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    year : str
        The desired year for BBL-level estimates. If None, the most recent year available will be used.

    Returns:
    --------
    pandas.DataFrame: 
        A table with population estimates by BBL ('bbl_population_estimate' column). 
        
    Notes:
    ------
        - The df include multiple geography columns. This will allow for the aggregation of 
        population numbers to various geographic levels. 
        - Avoid using estimates for individual BBLs; the more aggregation, the less error. 
        - Population numbers were estimated by multiplying the 'unitsres' and 'ct_population_density' columns. 'unitsres'
        specifies the number of residential units present at each BBL, and 'ct_population_density' represents the population
        density for units in each tract (division of the total population by the total number of residential units in each census
        tract).
