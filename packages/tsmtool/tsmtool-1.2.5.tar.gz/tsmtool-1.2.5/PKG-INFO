Tarsnap Status Monitor

## Introduction 
The most excellent backup service [Tarsnap](https://www.tarsnap.com) provides a clean
and functional interface for managing one's account.  This tool connects to that web
interface and queries data, producing a report as a table or JSON.  The current balance is
read, and an estimated monthly cost is calculated based on the site's daily cost data.

### Example Output
Here's an example of output from the author's tarsnap account:
```
(tsmtool) mkrueger@beaker:~/src/tsmtool$ tsmtool --json rstms
{
  "balance": 32.51,
  "account": "mkrueger@rstms.net",
  "monthly_cost": 23.51
}
```

## Configuration 
A config file may be used for account data, or the email account / password may be passed as command line options.
The config file is a whitespace delimited text file with one line per account.
Each line has these fields:

`~/.tsmtool`: 
```
ACCOUNT_NAME    EMAIL_ADDRESS   PASSWORD
```
