Currently(2025-01-27) conan-server was not supported in python 3.13 due to cgi module removed and (unupgraded) bottle dependency. So I created this package.

Conflict with official `conan` and `conan_server` package. Use virtual environment.

Will not keep sync with official repo; use at your own risk.
