features:
  - |
    The ``series download`` command now accepts an optional toggle flag pair,
    ``--separate`` / ``--combine``, to either download series patches to
    separate files or to a combined mbox file (default).
  - |
    The ``patch download``, ``bundle download``, and ``series download``
    commands now accept a directory for the ``OUTPUT`` argument as well as a
    file. If a directory is provided, the file will use the name provided
    by Patchwork but will be downloaded to the specified directory rather
    than the current working directory.
