# QuantEcon.py-wasm

QuantEcon's pure python package for WASM based environments. This library is a mirror of [QuantEcon.py](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py).
We highly recommend to use the original `quantecon` for better performance.

Anything that works with `quantecon_wasm.*` is expected to work with `quantecon.*` with equal or higher performance.

## Installation

You can install `quantecon_wasm` by opening a terminal prompt and typing

```
pip install quantecon_wasm
```
