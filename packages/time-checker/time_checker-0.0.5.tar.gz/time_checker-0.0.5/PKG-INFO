# Code-Time: A Reusable Timer Utility for Python Scripts

time-checker is a lightweight and reusable Python package for measuring the execution time of scripts, functions, and code blocks. Itâ€™s perfect for developers who want to profile their Python code quickly.

## Features
- **Function Timing**: Use a decorator to measure the execution time of any function.
- **Code Block Timing**: Use a context manager to time specific blocks of code.
- **Script Timing**: Easily measure the total execution time of your Python script.

## Installation
Install Time-Checker using pip:
```bash
pip install time-checker
```

## Usage

### 1. Timing Code Blocks
Use the `time_block` context manager to measure the time taken by a specific block of code:

```python
from time_checker import time_block

with time_block("Processing Loop"):
    for _ in range(10**6):
        pass
```
**Output:**
```
Processing Loop executed in 0.1234 seconds
```

### 2. Timing Functions
Use the `time_function` decorator to measure the time taken by any function:

```python
from time_checker import time_function

@time_function
def example_function():
    for _ in range(10**7):
        pass

example_function()
```
**Output:**
```
Function 'example_function' executed in 0.4567 seconds
```

### 3. Timing an Entire Script
Use the `script_timer` utility to measure the total execution time of a script:

```python
from time_checker import script_timer

with script_timer():
    print("Starting script...")
    for _ in range(10**6):
        pass
    print("Script complete.")
```
**Output:**
```
Starting script...
Script complete.
Script executed in 0.7890 seconds
```
