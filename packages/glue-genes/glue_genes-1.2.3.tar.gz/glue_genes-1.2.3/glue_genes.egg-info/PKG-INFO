The glue-genes meta-package
===========================

[glue genes](https://github.com/gluesolutions/glue-genes) is a custom version of the [glue software](https://glueviz.org) for the 
visual exploration of genomics data, developed in partnership with [The Jackson Laboratory](https://jax.org).

### Features

glue genes provides all the core features of glue:

* Interactive, linked statistical graphics
* A user interface for 'glueing' together multiple datasets with complicated relationships
* A highly scriptable and extendable environment

In addition, glue genes provides:

* Data loaders for genomics data file formats, including multiresolution images and transcriptomics data.
* Viewers including: 2D Heatmap, Small Multiples, QTL Viewer
* Menubar plug-ins to facilitate analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data

### Install

See [the glue genes documentation](https://glue-genes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/installation.html) for installation help.

We recommend installing into a new virtual environment. To install the current stable version use:

`pip install glue-genes[qt6]`

or 

`pip install glue-genes[qt5]`

depending on which version of Qt you would like to use.

To install the latest development version we recommend the following procedure in a new virtual environment:

`pip install "glue-genes[qt6]@git+https://git@github.com/gluesolutions/glue-genes.git"`

### Usage

After installation, glue (with the glue genes plug-ins loaded) can be invoked at the terminal:
`glue`


### Development

glue genes is under active development. Please file all bug reports as github issues.
