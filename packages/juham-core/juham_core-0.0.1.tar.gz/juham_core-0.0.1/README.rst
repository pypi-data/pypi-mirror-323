Welcome to Juham™ - Juha's Ultimate Home Automation Masterpiece
===============================================================

Description
-----------

The ``juham-core`` package introduces the ``Juham`` class, the core functionality for Juha's
ultimate home automation solution.

``Juham`` extend the functionality of ``Masterpiece`` object by adding capabilities for MQTT
communication and integration with time series databases. The base class provides only a minimal
set of interfaces. Actual features, such as MQTT and time series database implementations — along with home
automation-specific functionalities — are provided through separate plugin modules built on ``Juham`` class.


Project Status
--------------

**Current State**: **Pre-Alpha (Status 2)**  

In its current form, Juham™ may still resemble more of a home automation experiment (or even a "mess") than 
a "masterpiece," but I'm working hard to reach that goal!


Goals
-----

The aim of Juham™ is to have fun by learning Python and GitLab ecosystems, by developing a home automation
framework capable of controlling all the devices in my home, with the potential to be adapted for other homes as well.



Special Thanks
--------------

This project would not have been possible without the generous support of two exceptional 
individuals: my friend, **Teppo K.**, and my son, **Mahi**. 

- Teppo provided the initial spark for this project by donating a Raspberry Pi, a temperature sensor, and an inspiring demonstration of his own home automation system.
- My son Mahi has been instrumental in translating my ideas into Python code, offering invaluable support and encouragement throughout the development process.

I am deeply grateful to both of you — thank you!
