## Installation and getting started

Installing this package alone won't give you much benefit, unless of course you want to develop new omnisolver plugins. In that case, you can install `omnisolver` from pip:

```shell
pip install omnisolver
```

Algorithms for solving QUBO and Ising models are implemented in Omnisolver *plugins*. For instance, to use parallel tempering algorithm you need to install the `omnisolver-pt` package:

```shell
pip install omnisolver-pt
```

You can run the `omnisolver pt -h` command to see the command line usage.
