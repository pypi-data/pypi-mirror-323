## langflow-install

A simple installer that uses `uv` to install [langflow](langflow.org). 

with pipx:

    pipx run langflow_install

or with pip run:

    python -m pip install langflow-install
    langflow-install

with uvx

    uvx langflow_install


Then you can run `langflow run`

This project was heavily inspired by `aider-install`.
