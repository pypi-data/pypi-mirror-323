#### Create yaml config

_config.yaml_

```yaml
description: "Dynamic CLI Builder Example"
commands:
  - name: say_hello
    description: "Say Hello..."
    args:
      - name: name
        type: str
        help: "Name of the user."
    action: say_hello
```

#### Main file _main.py_

To bind this all together

```python
from dynamic_cli_builder import run_builder
from actions import ACTIONS

run_builder('config.yaml', ACTIONS)
```

#### CLI Command

##### Global Help

```
python3 <name_of_main_file> -h
```

For Instance:

```
python3 main.py -h
```

#### command specific help

```
 python3 <name_of_main_file> <name_of_command> -h
```

For Instance:

```
python3 main.py say_hello --name world

You should see
