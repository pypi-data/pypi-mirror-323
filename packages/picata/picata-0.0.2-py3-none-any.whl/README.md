# Picata

**This project is very much pre-alpha**

Picata is the CMS & blog application I've forked off from my personal website.
It's effectively a ton of pre-made Wagtail "stuff" (models, views, templatetags,
middleware, hooks, etc.), made generic enough that you can include this app
in your `INSTALLED_APPS` and have a CMS/blog up-and-running without having to
spend weeks or months tailoring Wagtail to your needs.
