NVIDIA TensorRT is an SDK that facilitates high-performance machine learning inference. It is designed to work in a complementary fashion with training frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet. It focuses specifically on running an already-trained network quickly and efficiently on NVIDIA hardware.

**IMPORTANT:** This is a special release of TensorRT designed to work only with TensorRT-LLM.
Please refrain from upgrading to this version if you are not using TensorRT-LLM.

To install, please execute the following:
```
pip install tensorrt --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
```
Or add the index URL to the (space-separated) PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable:
```
export PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL='https://pypi.nvidia.com'
pip install tensorrt
```
When the extra index url does not contain `https://pypi.nvidia.com`, a nested `pip install` will run with the proper extra index url hard-coded.
