## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

## Usage üìñ

```python
from aulos.TET12 import Note, PitchClass

print(Note("C#4"))
# stdout:
# <Note: C#4, scale: None>

print(PitchClass("C#"))
# stdout:
# <PitchClass: C#, scale: None>
```

```python
from aulos.TET12 import Key
from aulos.TET12 import Major, Dorian, Pentatonic

print(Major(Key("C")))
# stdout:
# <Major: <Key: C>>

print(Dorian(Key("C")).components)
# stdout:
# (<PitchClass: C, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: D, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: Eb, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: F, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: G, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: A, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: Bb, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>)

print(Pentatonic(Key("C")).components)
# stdout:
# (<PitchClass: C, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: D, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: E, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: G, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: A, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>)
```

```python
from aulos.TET12 import Note
from aulos.TET12 import JustIntonationTuner, Equal12Tuner

print(Note("C4", tuner=Equal12Tuner(440)).hz)
# stdout:
# 440.0

print(Note("A4", tuner=JustIntonationTuner(440)).hz)
# stdout:
# 733.3333333333333
