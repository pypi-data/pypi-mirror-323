**djb** combines a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) ASGI server with a [Vite](https://vite.dev/)+[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) frontend server running on the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) JavaScript runtime. Here's how it  works:

* **Django** prepares data and requests HTML pages from the frontend server via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).  
* **Frontend Server** renders and returns HTML, and prepares a JS bundle.
* **Browser** uses the JS bundle to make the page interactive.

When your project is ready to share, djb also provides tools for  deployment, making production as familiar and easy as local development.

```bash
