        contains confidential geoscience and drilling data owned by third parties.
        
        “Solo Cloud Public API” means a collection of routines, classes, function parameters,
        protocols, related libraries, tools and other instructions provided in source code or

        Application.
        
        “Python SDK” means the software development kit of tools developed by Rogii that
        enables access to the capabilities and features of Solo Cloud through the utilization of

# Rogii Solo

Rogii Solo is a Python SDK designed to make data scientists' work with Solo easier.

## Requirements
Python 3.10

## Installation
1. Install the package using `pip install rogii-solo` command.
2. Generate access credentials on the [landing page](https://solo.cloud/credentials/python-sdk) and copy the initialization string.
3. Initialize the client by pasting the initialization string in the constructor.
4. Set the project you wish to work with by name or UUID.

## Example
```python
from rogii_solo import SoloClient

solo_client = SoloClient(client_id='my-client-id', client_secret='my-client-secret')
project = solo_client.set_project_by_name('My project')

wells = project.wells

wells_data = wells.to_dict() # List of dicts
wells_df = wells.to_df() # DataFrame
```

## Usage
Please check the SDK documentation in our [Knowledge Base](https://kb.solo.cloud/Python+SDK).
