# opentrons-http-api

Python client for the [Opentrons HTTP API](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons-integration-tools/tree/main/http-api).

Stable, but not currently complete. It's relatively easy to add missing functions to the existing codebase, and PRs are welcome.

## Installation

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opentrons-http-api/):

```shell
pip install opentrons-http-api
```

## Usage

See [examples/robot_client/](examples/robot_client/) for usage examples.
