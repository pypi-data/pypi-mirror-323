# Summary

Accelerating materials discovery and optimization is crucial for transitioning 
to sustainable energy conversion and storage. In this regard, materials acceleration 
platforms (MAPs) can significantly shorten the discovery process, cutting material and 
labor costs [@aspuru2018materials]. Combinatorial and high-throughput methods are 
instrumental in developing said MAPs, enabling autonomous operation and the generation 
of large datasets [@maier2007combinatorial]. Therefore, in a previous work, we developed 
combinatorial deposition and analysis techniques for the discovery of new semiconductor 
materials [@wolf2023accelerated]. To drive further innovation in the field, COHESIVM was 
created, which facilitates combinatorial analysis of material and device properties 
through the following key features:

- A **generalized workflow** reduces redundancy and ensures consistency across different 
  experimental setups.
- The **modular design** abstracts devices, contact interfaces, and measurement routines 
  into interchangeable units.
- **Efficient data handling** is achieved through robust metadata collection and 
  well-structured storage.

# Statement of need

COHESIVM is a Python package that aims to streamline the setup and execution of
combinatorial voltaic measurements. Typically, experimental workflows and data handling 
are implemented on a use-case basis, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. With 
COHESIVM however, these foundational features are pre-implemented and designed to be 
reusable across different scenarios. The package provides a generalized framework, following 
well-documented abstract base classes, which facilitates the implementation of 
application-specific components. Additionally, graphical user interfaces allow users with 
less programming experience to execute experiments and analyze the collected data.

COHESIVM stands out for its straightforward design and the ease with which it can be 
interfaced with existing APIs to implement new devices seamlessly. While there are a number 
of tools available in the public domain that provide control over measurement equipment 
[@pernstich2012instrument; @weber2021pymodaq; @fuchs2024nomad], many of these tools focus 
primarily on graphical user interfaces which can limit their flexibility. Python APIs, such 
as ``bluesky`` [@allan2019bluesky], do offer experiment control and data collection capabilities. 
However, COHESIVM's advantage lies in its simplicity and targeted application in combinatorial 
experiments.

For the investigation of combinatorial optoelectronic devices, COHESIVM includes hardware descriptions
as well as implemented components which enable to quickly screen a matrix of 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 pixels 
on a single substrate (25&nbsp;mm × 25&nbsp;mm). The package's documentation provides a 
[high-level description](https://cohesivm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/real-world_example.html) of how COHESIVM can be applied in this context. In brief, 
64 gold pads are sputtered onto the sample using a mask which is [available in the repository](https://github.com/mxwalbert/cohesivm/tree/main/hardware/ma8x8). 
Schematics and board files for reproducing the utilized ``MA8X8`` interface are provided
as well. After mounting the sample on this interface, it is placed under a solar simulator 
(Ossila, AAA classification) and connected to the electronic measurement equipment (Agilent 4156C). 
Employing the ``CurrentVoltageCharacteristic`` measurement class, the IV curves of all 64 pixels are 
recorded and the resulting data yields a map of open-circuit voltages.
