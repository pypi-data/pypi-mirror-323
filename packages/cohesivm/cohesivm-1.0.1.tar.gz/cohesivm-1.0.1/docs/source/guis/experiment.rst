Experiment GUI
==============

This Graphical User Interface enables to monitor and control an experiment.

Environment
-----------

.. include:: ../_snippets/important_gui_extra.rst

We use the code from the test of the :class:`~cohesivm.gui.ExperimentGUI` for demonstrating its functionality:

.. code-block:: python

    import cohesivm
    import multiprocessing
    import numpy as np


    class DemoDevice(cohesivm.devices.Device):
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            cohesivm.devices.Device.__init__(self, [None])

        def _establish_connection(self) -> None:
            pass


    class DemoInterface(cohesivm.interfaces.Interface):
        _interface_type = cohesivm.interfaces.InterfaceType.Demo1
        _interface_dimensions = cohesivm.database.Dimensions.Point()
        _contact_ids = ['11', '12', '21', '22']
        _contact_positions = {contact: position for contact, position in zip(_contact_ids, [(0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0)])}

        def __init__(self) -> None:
            cohesivm.interfaces.Interface.__init__(self, cohesivm.database.Dimensions.Point())

        def _select_contact(self, contact: str) -> None:
            pass


    class DemoMeasurement(cohesivm.measurements.Measurement):
            _name = 'demo'
            _interface_type = cohesivm.interfaces.InterfaceType.Demo1
            _required_channels = []
            _output_type = np.dtype([('x', float), ('y', float)])

            def __init__(self) -> None:
                cohesivm.measurements.Measurement.__init__(self, {}, (10, 2))

            def run(self, device: cohesivm.devices.Device, data_stream: multiprocessing.Queue) -> np.ndarray:
                results = []
                for i in range(10):
                    result = (i, i*i)
                    data_stream.put(result)
                    results.append(result)
                    time.sleep(1)
                return np.array(results)


    db = cohesivm.database.Database('test_experiment_gui.h5')
    interface = DemoInterface()
    measurement = DemoMeasurement()
    device = DemoDevice()

    experiment = cohesivm.experiment.Experiment(
        database=db,
        device=device,
        measurement=measurement,
        interface=interface,
        sample_id='test',
        selected_contacts=['11', '12', '22']
    )

    plot = cohesivm.gui.XYDataStreamPlot('a', 'b')

    experiment_gui = cohesivm.gui.ExperimentGUI(experiment=experiment, plot=plot)
    experiment_gui.display()

Firstly, we implement the required components for running an :class:`~cohesivm.experiment.Experiment`:

1.  The :class:`~cohesivm.devices.Device` should not do anything, so we can just define empty methods.
2.  In the :class:`~cohesivm.interfaces.Interface`, we need to implement
    the :attr:`~cohesivm.interfaces.Interface.contact_positions` which determines how the Control section of
    the :class:`~cohesivm.gui.ExperimentGUI` will look like.
3.  Since we want to simulate how the data from a :class:`~cohesivm.measurements.Measurement` would be visualized,
    we should define a :meth:`~cohesivm.measurements.Measurement.run` that sequentially puts data into
    the ``data_stream``.

Then, we initialize the components and the :class:`~cohesivm.experiment.Experiment` with the only notable detail that
the ``selected_contacts`` are only three out of the four which we defined in the ``DemoInterface``.

Usage
-----

As a result of running the code above in a Jupyter Notebook, the following GUI should be displayed:

.. image:: /_static/img/gui_experiment_1.png

On the left panel "Control", you see the current :class:`~cohesivm.experiment.ExperimentState`, followed by a
representation of the :class:`~cohesivm.interfaces.Interface` and the control buttons at the bottom.

The dots, which represent the individual contacts with their respective
:attr:`~cohesivm.interfaces.Interface.contact_ids`, are colored according to their current state (in this case gray
for ``INITIAL``). The black dot is the contact which was left out when the ``selected_contacts`` was defined above.
If you click on a dot, a preview measurement will run which actually performs the measurement but does not store any
data. This way, you can check if you chose the correct measurement settings:

.. image:: /_static/img/gui_experiment_2.png

As you can see, the state in the "Control" panel changed to ``RUNNING`` and the dot you clicked on turned green. On the
right "Plot" panel you can see the current results and the plot gets updated as new data arrives. In this case, the
graph is a simple x-y-plot (:class:`~cohesivm.gui.XYDataStreamPlot`) as defined in the example code but more complex
ones may also be implemented, following the :class:`~cohesivm.gui.DataStreamPlot` abstract base class. The title of
the plot provides the specific information that you are running a :meth:`~cohesivm.experiment.Experiment.preview` and
states the ID of the currently selected contact.

Now, if you are satisfied with the measurement settings and the selection of contacts, you simply `Setup` the
experiment and hit `Start`. The former button click will turn the dots yellow and create a dataset entry. This can be
deleted by clicking the `Abort` button which may also be clicked during a measurement to cancel an experiment. Finally,
``FINISHED`` measurements will be indicated by blue dots:
