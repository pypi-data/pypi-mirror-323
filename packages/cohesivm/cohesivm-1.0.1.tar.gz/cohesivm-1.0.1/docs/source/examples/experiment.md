# Run an Experiment

Follow the {doc}`Basic Usage</getting_started/basic_usage>` example to set up and run an 
{class}`~cohesivm.experiment.Experiment`. If you do not have all components ready yet, follow these tutorials:

- {doc}`Implement a Device</tutorials/device>`
- {doc}`Implement an Interface</tutorials/interface>`
- {doc}`Implement a Measurement</tutorials/measurement>`

To follow the other examples you may just run the code from the {doc}`Basic Usage</getting_started/basic_usage>` 
example even if you do not have access to the hardware. This will fail but create an HDF5 file and store an empty 
dataset entry.
