"""This module contains the :class:`Channel` Abstract Base Class which should be inherited by device channels. The main
responsibility is to execute actions on the physical device channels for which the device
:attr:`~cohesivm.channels.Channel.connection` is stored.

Furthermore, all possible channel methods are defined in the :class:`Channel` in order for a
:class:`~cohesivm.measurements.Measurement` to recognize them. Trait classes, e.g., :class:`Voltmeter`, will inherit
these methods and set the ones that must be implemented abstract. Then they can be used to be implemented in a device
module and for the compatibility check of the :class:`~cohesivm.experiment.Experiment`."""
