# CLI Helper Tool

A CLI helper tool that helps with day-to-day commands and automates software development tasks. This tool provides configuration management and a CLI-friendly cyborg tool for other tasks.

## Installation

### Key Updates:
1. **Changed Command Name to `pilot`**: Since your tool is published as `cli` but should be executed with the `pilot` command, Iâ€™ve updated all references of the command to `pilot`.
2. **Clarified Installation**: Both `pip` and `Poetry` installation methods are included for flexibility.

This README should now correctly reflect your tool's installation and usage instructions with the proper command (`pilot`).
