# `@blimmer/cdk-github-oidc`

This repository contains constructs to communicate between GitHub Actions and AWS via an Open ID Connect (OIDC)
provider. The process is described in
[this GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).

## Security Benefits

By using the OpenID Connect provider, you can communicate with AWS from GitHub Actions without saving static credentials
(e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) in your GitHub Actions secret variables. Removing static
credentials is a best practice for security.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```shell
npm install --save @blimmer/cdk-github-oidc
```

or

```shell
yarn add @blimmer/cdk-github-oidc
```

### Create or Import a Provider

Each AWS account must be bootstrapped with an OIDC provider. Use the `GithubActionsIdentityProvider` construct to create
a new provider.

```python
import { GithubActionsIdentityProvider } from "@blimmer/cdk-github-oidc";

export class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const provider = new GithubActionsIdentityProvider(this, "Provider");
  }
}
```

If you want to use an existing provider, you can import it using the `GithubActionsIdentityProvider.fromAccount()`
method.

```python
import { GithubActionsIdentityProvider } from "@blimmer/cdk-github-oidc";

export class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const provider = GithubActionsIdentityProvider.fromAccount(this);
  }
}
```

### Create a Role

Once you have a handle to a provider, you can create a role assumed by GitHub Actions.

```python
import { GithubActionsRole, GithubActionsIdentityProvider, BranchFilter } from "@blimmer/cdk-github-oidc";

export class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const provider = new GithubActionsIdentityProvider(this, "Provider");

    const role = new GithubActionsRole(this, "Role", {
      provider,
      roleName: "my-github-actions-role",
      description: "Role assumed by GitHub Actions",
      subjectFilters: [new BranchFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", branch: "*" })],
    });
  }
}
```

### Subject Filters

As you can see in the example above, you must pass one or more `SubjectFilter`s to the `GithubActionsRole` construct.
These filters are used to determine which GitHub Actions workflows can assume the role.

This construct exposes first class support for the following filters:

* [`BranchFilter`](/API.md#branchfilter)

  ```python
  // Allow all branches
  new BranchFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", branch: "*" });

  // Specify a branch
  new BranchFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", branch: "main" });

  // Specify a branch pattern
  new BranchFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", branch: "feature/*" });
  ```
* [`TagFilter`](/API.md#tagfilter)

  ```python
  // Allow all tags
  new TagFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", tag: "*" });

  // Specify a tag
  new TagFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", tag: "v1.0.0" });

  // Specify a tag pattern
  new TagFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", tag: "v1.*" });
  ```
* [`EnvironmentFilter`](/API.md#environmentfilter)

  ```python
  // Allow all environments
  new EnvironmentFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", environment: "*" });

  // Specify an environment
  new EnvironmentFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", environment: "staging" });
  ```
* [`PullRequestFilter`](/API.md#pullrequestfilter)

  ```python
  // Allow all pull requests
  new PullRequestFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc" });
  ```

If none of these filters fit your use case, you can implement your via the
[`IGithubActionOidcFilter`](/API.md#igithubactionoidcfilter) interface, or use the
[`CustomFilter`](/API.md#customfilter) construct.

You can learn more about subject filters in the
[Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#configuring-the-subject-in-your-cloud-provider)

### Granting Permissions to the Role

The `GithubActionsRole` construct *is a* `Role` construct, so you can use all of the same properties and methods as you
would with a normal CDK IAM `Role` construct.

```python
import { GithubActionsRole, GithubActionsIdentityProvider, BranchFilter } from "@blimmer/cdk-github-oidc";
import { Bucket } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3";
import { PolicyStatement } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam";

export class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const bucket = new Bucket(this, "Bucket");

    const provider = new GithubActionsIdentityProvider(this, "Provider");
    const role = new GithubActionsRole(this, "Role", {
      provider,
      roleName: "my-github-actions-role",
      description: "Role assumed by GitHub Actions",
      subjectFilters: [new BranchFilter({ owner: "blimmer", repository: "cdk-github-oidc", branch: "*" })],
    });

    // Grant access via CDK `grant*` methods
    // https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/permissions.html#permissions_grants
    role.grantReadWrite(bucket);

    // Add a custom policy
    role.addToPolicy(new PolicyStatement({ actions: ["s3:PutObject"], resources: ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"] }));
  }
}
```

### Using a Role in a Workflow

To use a role in a GitHub Actions workflow, you can use the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write # Required for OIDC role assumption
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-github-actions-role
          region: us-west-2
```

See [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` docs](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) for
more details.

## Usage

For detailed API docs, see [API.md](/API.md).

## Python

This package is available for Python as `cdk-github-oidc`.

```bash
pip install cdk-github-oidc
```

## Migrating from `aws-cdk-github-oidc`

This package was inspired by [`aws-cdk-github-oidc`](https://github.com/aripalo/aws-cdk-github-oidc), but this package
became somewhat unmaintained.

For a role that looked like this in `aws-cdk-github-oidc`:

```python
import { GithubActionsIdentityProvider, GithubActionsRole } from "aws-cdk-github-oidc";

const provider = new GithubActionsIdentityProvider(scope, "GithubProvider");
const deployRole = new GithubActionsRole(scope, "DeployRole", {
  provider,
  owner: "octo-org",
  repo: "octo-repo",
  roleName: "MyDeployRole",
  description: "This role deploys stuff to AWS",
  maxSessionDuration: cdk.Duration.hours(2),
});
```

The equivalent role in this package looks like this:

```python
import { GithubActionsIdentityProvider, GithubActionsRole, BranchFilter } from "@blimmer/cdk-github-oidc";

const provider = new GithubActionsIdentityProvider(scope, "GithubProvider");
const deployRole = new GithubActionsRole(scope, "DeployRole", {
  provider,
  roleName: "MyDeployRole",
  description: "This role deploys stuff to AWS",
  subjectFilters: [new BranchFilter({ owner: "octo-org", repository: "octo-repo", branch: "*" })],
  maxSessionDuration: cdk.Duration.hours(2),
});
```
