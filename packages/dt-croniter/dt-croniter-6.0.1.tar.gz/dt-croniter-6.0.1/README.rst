DISCLAIMER - ABANDONED/UNMAINTAINED CODE / DO NOT USE
=======================================================
While this repository has been inactive for some time, this formal notice, issued on **December 10, 2024**, serves as the official declaration to clarify the situation. Consequently, this repository and all associated resources (including related projects, code, documentation, and distributed packages such as Docker images, PyPI packages, etc.) are now explicitly declared **unmaintained** and **abandoned**.

I would like to remind everyone that this project’s free license has always been based on the principle that the software is provided "AS-IS", without any warranty or expectation of liability or maintenance from the maintainer.
As such, it is used solely at the user's own risk, with no warranty or liability from the maintainer, including but not limited to any damages arising from its use.

Due to the enactment of the Cyber Resilience Act (EU Regulation 2024/2847), which significantly alters the regulatory framework, including penalties of up to €15M, combined with its demands for **unpaid** and **indefinite** liability, it has become untenable for me to continue maintaining all my Open Source Projects as a natural person.
The new regulations impose personal liability risks and create an unacceptable burden, regardless of my personal situation now or in the future, particularly when the work is done voluntarily and without compensation.

**No further technical support, updates (including security patches), or maintenance, of any kind, will be provided.**

These resources may remain online, but solely for public archiving, documentation, and educational purposes.

Users are strongly advised not to use these resources in any active or production-related projects, and to seek alternative solutions that comply with the new legal requirements (EU CRA).

**Using these resources outside of these contexts is strictly prohibited and is done at your own risk.**

Regarding the potential transfer of the project to another entity, discussions are ongoing, but no final decision has been made yet. As a last resort, if the project and its associated resources are not transferred, I may begin removing any published resources related to this project (e.g., from PyPI, Docker Hub, GitHub, etc.) starting **March 15, 2025**, especially if the CRA’s risks remain disproportionate.

Usage
============

A simple example::

    >>> from croniter import croniter
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> base = datetime(2010, 1, 25, 4, 46)
    >>> iter = croniter('*/5 * * * *', base)  # every 5 minutes
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-25 04:50:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-25 04:55:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-25 05:00:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('2 4 * * mon,fri', base)  # 04:02 on every Monday and Friday
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-26 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-30 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-02 04:02:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('2 4 1 * wed', base)  # 04:02 on every Wednesday OR on 1st day of month
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-27 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-01 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-03 04:02:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('2 4 1 * wed', base, day_or=False)  # 04:02 on every 1st day of the month if it is a Wednesday
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-09-01 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-12-01 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2011-06-01 04:02:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('0 0 * * sat#1,sun#2', base)  # 1st Saturday, and 2nd Sunday of the month
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-06 00:00:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('0 0 * * 5#3,L5', base)  # 3rd and last Friday of the month
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-29 00:00:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-19 00:00:00


All you need to know is how to use the constructor and the ``get_next``
method, the signature of these methods are listed below::

    >>> def __init__(self, cron_format, start_time=time.time(), day_or=True)

croniter iterates along with ``cron_format`` from ``start_time``.
``cron_format`` is **min hour day month day_of_week**, you can refer to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron for more details. The ``day_or``
switch is used to control how croniter handles **day** and **day_of_week**
entries. Default option is the cron behaviour, which connects those
values using **OR**. If the switch is set to False, the values are connected
using **AND**. This behaves like fcron and enables you to e.g. define a job that
executes each 2nd Friday of a month by setting the days of month and the
weekday.
::

    >>> def get_next(self, ret_type=float)

get_next calculates the next value according to the cron expression and
returns an object of type ``ret_type``. ``ret_type`` should be a ``float`` or a
``datetime`` object.

Supported added for ``get_prev`` method. (>= 0.2.0)::

    >>> base = datetime(2010, 8, 25)
    >>> itr = croniter('0 0 1 * *', base)
    >>> print(itr.get_prev(datetime))  # 2010-08-01 00:00:00
    >>> print(itr.get_prev(datetime))  # 2010-07-01 00:00:00
    >>> print(itr.get_prev(datetime))  # 2010-06-01 00:00:00

You can validate your crons using ``is_valid`` class method. (>= 0.3.18)::

    >>> croniter.is_valid('0 0 1 * *')  # True
    >>> croniter.is_valid('0 wrong_value 1 * *')  # False

About DST
=========
Be sure to init your croniter instance with a TZ aware datetime for this to work!

Example using pytz::

    >>> import pytz
    >>> tz = pytz.timezone("Europe/Paris")
    >>> local_date = tz.localize(datetime(2017, 3, 26))
    >>> val = croniter('0 0 * * *', local_date).get_next(datetime)

Example using python_dateutil::

    >>> import dateutil.tz
    >>> tz = dateutil.tz.gettz('Asia/Tokyo')
    >>> local_date = datetime(2017, 3, 26, tzinfo=tz)
    >>> val = croniter('0 0 * * *', local_date).get_next(datetime)

Example using python built in module::

    >>> from datetime import datetime, timezone
    >>> local_date = datetime(2017, 3, 26, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    >>> val = croniter('0 0 * * *', local_date).get_next(datetime)

About second repeats
=====================
Croniter is able to do second repetition crontabs form and by default seconds are the 6th field::

    >>> base = datetime(2012, 4, 6, 13, 26, 10)
    >>> itr = croniter('* * * * * 15,25', base)
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 4/6 13:26:15
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 4/6 13:26:25
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 4/6 13:27:15

You can also note that this expression will repeat every second from the start datetime.::

    >>> croniter('* * * * * *', local_date).get_next(datetime)

You can also use seconds as first field::

    >>> itr = croniter('15,25 * * * * *', base, second_at_beginning=True)


About year
===========
Croniter also support year field.
Year presents at the seventh field, which is after second repetition.
The range of year field is from 1970 to 2099.
To ignore second repetition, simply set second to ``0`` or any other const::

    >>> base = datetime(2012, 4, 6, 2, 6, 59)
    >>> itr = croniter('0 0 1 1 * 0 2020/2', base)
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 2020 1/1 0:0:0
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 2022 1/1 0:0:0
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 2024 1/1 0:0:0

Support for start_time shifts
==============================
See https://github.com/kiorky/croniter/pull/76,
You can set start_time=, then expand_from_start_time=True for your generations to be computed from start_time instead of calendar days::

    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> iter = croniter('0 0 */7 * *', start_time=datetime(2024, 7, 11), expand_from_start_time=True);pprint([iter.get_next(datetime) for a in range(10)])
    [datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 18, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 25, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 4, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 11, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 18, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 25, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 4, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 11, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 18, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 25, 0, 0)]
    >>> # INSTEAD OF THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:
    >>> iter = croniter('0 0 */7 * *', start_time=datetime(2024, 7, 11), expand_from_start_time=False);pprint([iter.get_next(datetime) for a in range(10)])
    [datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 15, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 22, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 1, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 8, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 15, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 22, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 29, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 1, 0, 0),
     datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 8, 0, 0)]


Testing if a date matches a crontab
===================================
Test for a match with (>=0.3.32)::

    >>> croniter.match("0 0 * * *", datetime(2019, 1, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0))
    True
    >>> croniter.match("0 0 * * *", datetime(2019, 1, 14, 0, 2, 0, 0))
    False
    >>>
    >>> croniter.match("2 4 1 * wed", datetime(2019, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0, 0)) # 04:02 on every Wednesday OR on 1st day of month
    True
    >>> croniter.match("2 4 1 * wed", datetime(2019, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0, 0), day_or=False) # 04:02 on every 1st day of the month if it is a Wednesday
    False

Testing if a crontab matches in datetime range
==============================================
Test for a match_range with (>=2.0.3)::

    >>> croniter.match_range("0 0 * * *", datetime(2019, 1, 13, 0, 59, 0, 0), datetime(2019, 1, 14, 0, 1, 0, 0))
    True
    >>> croniter.match_range("0 0 * * *", datetime(2019, 1, 13, 0, 1, 0, 0), datetime(2019, 1, 13, 0, 59, 0, 0))
    False
    >>> croniter.match_range("2 4 1 * wed", datetime(2019, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0), datetime(2019, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 0))
    # 04:02 on every Wednesday OR on 1st day of month
    True
    >>> croniter.match_range("2 4 1 * wed", datetime(2019, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0), datetime(2019, 1, 1, 5, 2, 0, 0), day_or=False)
    # 04:02 on every 1st day of the month if it is a Wednesday
    False

Gaps between date matches
=========================
For performance reasons, croniter limits the amount of CPU cycles spent attempting to find the next match.
Starting in v0.3.35, this behavior is configurable via the ``max_years_between_matches`` parameter, and the default window has been increased from 1 year to 50 years.

The defaults should be fine for many use cases.
Applications that evaluate multiple cron expressions or handle cron expressions from untrusted sources or end-users should use this parameter.
Iterating over sparse cron expressions can result in increased CPU consumption or a raised ``CroniterBadDateError`` exception which indicates that croniter has given up attempting to find the next (or previous) match.
Explicitly specifying ``max_years_between_matches`` provides a way to limit CPU utilization and simplifies the iterable interface by eliminating the need for ``CroniterBadDateError``.
The difference in the iterable interface is based on the reasoning that whenever ``max_years_between_matches`` is explicitly agreed upon, there is no need for croniter to signal that it has given up; simply stopping the iteration is preferable.

This example matches 4 AM Friday, January 1st.
Since January 1st isn't often a Friday, there may be a few years between each occurrence.
Setting the limit to 15 years ensures all matches::

    >>> it = croniter("0 4 1 1 fri", datetime(2000,1,1), day_or=False, max_years_between_matches=15).all_next(datetime)
    >>> for i in range(5):
    ...     print(next(it))
    ...
    2010-01-01 04:00:00
    2016-01-01 04:00:00
    2021-01-01 04:00:00
    2027-01-01 04:00:00
    2038-01-01 04:00:00

However, when only concerned with dates within the next 5 years, simply set ``max_years_between_matches=5`` in the above example.
This will result in no matches found, but no additional cycles will be wasted on unwanted matches far in the future.

Iterating over a range using cron
=================================
Find matches within a range using the ``croniter_range()`` function.  This is much like the builtin ``range(start,stop,step)`` function, but for dates.  The `step` argument is a cron expression.
Added in (>=0.3.34)

List the first Saturday of every month in 2019::

    >>> from croniter import croniter_range
    >>> for dt in croniter_range(datetime(2019, 1, 1), datetime(2019, 12, 31), "0 0 * * sat#1"):
    >>>     print(dt)


Hashed expressions
==================

croniter supports Jenkins-style hashed expressions, using the "H" definition keyword and the required hash_id keyword argument.
Hashed expressions remain consistent, given the same hash_id, but different hash_ids will evaluate completely different to each other.
This allows, for example, for an even distribution of differently-named jobs without needing to manually spread them out.

    >>> itr = croniter("H H * * *", hash_id="hello")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 10, 11, 10)
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 11, 11, 10)
    >>> itr = croniter("H H * * *", hash_id="hello")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 10, 11, 10)
    >>> itr = croniter("H H * * *", hash_id="bonjour")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 10, 20, 52)


Random expressions
==================

Random "R" definition keywords are supported, and remain consistent only within their croniter() instance.

    >>> itr = croniter("R R * * *")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 10, 22, 56)
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 11, 22, 56)
    >>> itr = croniter("R R * * *")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 11, 4, 19)


Note about Ranges
=================

Note that as a deviation from cron standard, croniter is somehow laxist with ranges and will allow ranges of ``Jan-Dec``, & ``Sun-Sat`` in reverse way and interpret them as following examples:

    - ``Apr-Jan``: from April to january
    - ``Sat-Sun``: Saturday, Sunday
    - ``Wed-Sun``: Wednesday to Saturday, Sunday

Please note that if a /step is given, it will be respected.

Note about Sunday
=================

Note that as a deviation from cron standard, croniter like numerous cron implementations supports ``SUNDAY`` to be expressed as ``DAY7``, allowing such expressions:

    - ``0 0 * * 7``
    - ``0 0 * * 6-7``
    - ``0 0 * * 6,7``


Keyword expressions
===================

Vixie cron-style "@" keyword expressions are supported.
What they evaluate to depends on whether you supply hash_id: no hash_id corresponds to Vixie cron definitions (exact times, minute resolution), while with hash_id corresponds to Jenkins definitions (hashed within the period, second resolution).

    ============ ============ ================
    Keyword      No hash_id   With hash_id
