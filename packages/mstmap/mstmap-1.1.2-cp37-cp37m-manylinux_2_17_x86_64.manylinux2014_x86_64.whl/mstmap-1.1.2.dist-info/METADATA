# MSTmap Python

# Introduction
MSTmap is a software tool that builds genetic linkage maps efficiently and accurately.

- Extremely fast and computationally efficient
- Written in Python, Cython, and C++
- Find the web version here [https://mstmap.org/](https://mstmap.org/)
- This repo contains the Python library for the original C++ software [https://github.com/ucrbioinfo/MSTmap](https://github.com/ucrbioinfo/MSTmap) presented in [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000212](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000212)
