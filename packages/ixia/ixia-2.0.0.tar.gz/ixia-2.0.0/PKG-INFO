# Ixia
Ixia is a cryptographically secure Python RNG library. It mainly merges
`secrets`' security with `random`'s versatility, but also rolls some of its own
functions, such as [`ixia.passphrase()`][ixia-passphrase],
[`ixia.shuffled()`][ixia-shuffled],
or [`ixia.universe_rand()`][ixia-universe-rand].
All random values are generated using `urandom`
(or `BCryptGenRandom` onWindows).

## Installation
Ixia is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip, or any other Python
package manager:
```sh
pip install ixia
```
(Some systems may require you to use `pip3`, `python -m pip`, or `py -m pip`
instead.)

## Documentation
Ixia documentation is available at https://trag1c.github.io/ixia/.

> [!warning]
> While supporting Python 3.9+, Ixia is based on the Python 3.13 implementation
> of the `random` module. The following changes have been made to the module
> since Python 3.9:
> - `gauss`, `expovariate` and `normalvariate` have default parameter values
> - `binomialvariate` was added
>
> Additionally, Ixia executes 3.9+ deprecations, thus:
> - `ixia.rand_range` doesn't convert non-integer types to equivalent integers
> - `ixia.sample` doesn't support `set` as a sequence type
> - `ixia.shuffle` doesn't support the `random` parameter
