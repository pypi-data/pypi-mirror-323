# Summary
This package uses Wikimedia REST APIs to retrieve word and audio file
information from Wiktionary. Audio files selected by the user can also be
downloaded for most languages. There is also functionality to parse the
dictionary entries for German, Polish, and Czech words to extract much of
the page information as object attributes. A git repository for this 
package is located [on github](https://github.com/ghrgriner/wikwork).
Additional documentation might be added in
[the wiki](https://github.com/ghrgriner/wikwork/wiki) of the repository.

# Wikimedia API Terms and Conditions
The REST APIs used are an interface provided by Wikimedia. The version
used is version 1. APIs from two sets of Wikimedia APIs are used. For want of
a better term, we refer to these as 'old' and 'new' API sets. See the
API documentation for global rules, content licensing, and terms of service.

The documentation for the 'old' `/page/media-list/{title}/{revision}` API
(which is used to get the list of audio files associated with a headword)
is at:
   `https://[xx].wiktionary.org/api/rest_v1`, where
`[xx]` is replaced by the language code of the Wiktionary (eg,
   https://en.wiktionary.org/api/rest_v1 for the English Wiktionary).

The documentation for the 'new' set of APIs (all other APIs used by the package)
is at:
   https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Core_REST_API.

# Release Notes (v0.8.0)
- The old set of APIs stopped working when retrieving the HTML and source
  for media files (i.e., pages in the 'File' namespace). Therefore, most old
  APIs were replaced with new ones. The 'etag' is handled as before for APIs
  that return it (i.e., the value is cached), but it is likely to be deprecated
  in the future, as it is no longer needed to retrieve wikitext.
- The new set of APIs seems to have stricter enforcement of rate limits.
  See the links above for details.
- The output structure of requests differs under new APIs and old APIs.
  Therefore, files cached under previous versions will likely not work, and it's
  recommended to create a new cache directory for this version.
- The error reporting in this version isn't great. Requests that fail for some
  some reason other than a 404 (File not Found) error likely manifest in the
  log as:
  `ERROR - Lang {lang_code}, Word {word}: revision not in X response (bad key): status N`,
  where N is the `httpCode` from the request output, and X is either absent
  (for a wikitext request), `html` (for an html request) or `bare`
  (for a request to get the bare page). This error is triggered when the
  request output doesn't have a 'latest' item that contains an 'id' item.
- Comments in the module docstring were significantly reduced.

# Functionality
This package extracts word and audio file information from Wiktionary.
Audio files selected by the user can also be downloaded. For German,
Polish, and Czech words, the most common elements of the dictionary entry
or entries for a word can be extracted into separate fields. Similar
functionality may be added in the future for other languages, or users can
write their own parsers on the downloaded objects.

Downloading all audio files for a given headword (ie, page or page title)
technically only requires two REST API calls, one to get the list of audio
files for the headword and then to download the audio file. However, doing
this and nothing else would ignore the downloader's potential attribution
and other responsibilities imposed by the file licenses. Furthermore, the
audio files obtained from the media list API for a given headword should
consist of all audio files from the headword page, including those in
languages other than the one in which the Wiktionary is written.

The package therefore contains the following functionality:

1. Automatic removal of audio files that are likely (based on file naming
convention) not pronunciations in the target language.

2. Creation of a yes/no flag to indicate whether the audio file is
probably a pronunciation of the headword and not, say, an example
expression (again based on file naming conventions).

3. Assignment of probable authors, probable licenses, and probable
attributions (when audio file author/uploader specifies an attribution
parameter that differs from the author) based on parsing the wikitext of
the file that is meant to contain such information. The parsing of such
text files may not be perfect, and therefore users should review these
assigned elements with the wikitext to confirm the necessary information
was correctly extracted.  A wrapper function is provided to print the
probable license, probable author, probable attribution, and wikitext to a
single file for easier review. Users should also check that the templates
that hold license and author information for their selected audio files
still have the same parameters and interpretation as when the default
parser was written.

4. Support for user-created functions that assign the probable authors,
probable licenses, and probable attributions for users that want to write
their own parser or write a wrapper around a parser from a different
third-party package.

5. Sorting of audio files by user-defined keys (which might include sorting
by preferred probable licenses, probable authors, language variants [eg,
American vs British English], or pronunciations).

6. Creation of cache/output directories that will store downloaded HTML and
wikitext information. Users can configure whether or not to use the cache.
Page revision is part of the key when retrieving from the cache, so
deletion of the cache files with the revision information will result in
the latest revision number being retrieved. If the revision is not changed
and reading from the cache is configured, the program will know there is
no need to re-update the media list or HTML/wikitext output for the page.

7. An easy-to-use wrapper that downloads headword and audio file
information into objects, and then optionally outputs the results in a
text file at the word or audio file level.

8. Downloading of audio files specified by the user.

9. Support to sleep a specified amount of time after a REST API call to
comply with Wikimedia™ rate limits.

10. Logging using the `logging` package is used in the standard manner
with a null handler attached in the `__init__.py`.

11. Support for `GermanWord` objects, which are like `Headword` objects,
but have an additional list of grammar information for each dictionary
entry (ie, for each third-level heading in the page). The information
extracted includes: word separation information, pronunciations,
abbreviations, definitions, origins, synonyms, opposites, hyponyms,
hypernyms, examples, expressions, characteristic word combinations, word
formations, references and additional information, sources, alternate
spellings, sayings/proverbs, comparative and superlative form(s) of
adjectives, verb forms (first, second and third person singular present,
first/third singular preterite, past participle, helper verb, and the
Subjunctive II [Konjuntiv II]), the usual 8 noun declinations (4 cases by
singular/plural) and whether the noun declines as an adjective). Note that
the page information is broken up into the sections above, but the
wikitext is not completely transcluded (ie, replaced with plain text).

12. Support for `PolishWord` objects, which are like `Headword` objects,
but have an additional list of over sixty attributes with grammar
information for the dictionary entry. The information extracted includes:
pronunciations, definitions, etymology, synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms,
hypernyms, examples, expressions, word combinations, word formations,
references, syntax, meronyms, holonyms, and cautions. Up to two
comparative forms for the adjective are presented, along with over 15
verb conjugated or derived forms, noun gender (both as {'m','f','n'} and
also as subcategories for the masculine nouns by person, animal, and/or
thing.), and the usual 14 declinations (7 cases by singular/plural). 
Note that the page information is broken up into the sections listed
above, but the wikitext is not completely transcluded (ie, replaced with
plain text).

13. Support for `CzechWord` objects, which are like `Headword` objects,
but have an additional list of over sixty attributes with grammar
information for the dictionary entry. The information extracted includes
at the word level: pronunciations, word separations, etymology, external
links, variants, and references. At the entry level, attributes include:
definitions, etymology (if differs by entry), synonyms, antonyms, examples,
expressions, sayings, related words, variants, word combinations,
abbreviations, declensions, collocations, and part of speech summary and
detail information. Up to two comparative forms for the adjective are
presented, along with almost 30 verb conjugated or derived forms, noun
gender (both as {'m','f','n'} and also as subcategories for the masculine
nouns by animate/inanimate, and the usual 14 noun declinations (7 cases by
singular/plural).  Note that the page information is broken up into the
sections listed above, but the wikitext is not completely transcluded (ie,
replaced with plain text).

# Audio File Download
The package allows users to select audio files for download along with
tools to help them decide which files to download. The process is designed
to be a multi-step process. For motivation, consider the following
examples from the German wiktionary:

- The word 'Blut' has three pronunciations uploaded, two by speakers raised
in Germany and one by speaker raised in Austria, and the three
pronunciations are released under three different open source licenses.

- The page for the word 'operieren' has 14 pronunciations uploaded. Two of
these are pronunciations of the word itself, and 12 are phrases using the
word.

- Most common words ending in '-ig' have at least two pronunciations
uploaded, one presenting the ending pronounced as '-ik' [IPA: -ɪk] and the
other with the ending pronounced as '-isch' [IPA: -ɪç]).

An example workflow is described below. The example presents parameters
from the `wrapper.words_wrapper` method, but the methods from the
`AudioFile` and `Headword` classes can also be called directly. See the
package docstrings for additional details.

1. User identifies for which 'words' they want audios. These are passed
to the wrapper by in a file where the filename is specified in the
`input_words_filename` parameter. The file should have a header of `Word`
as the first line with each word to look up on a subsequent line. Here
'word' refers to a page in the Wiktionary for a given headword, i.e., the
page at `https://[lang].wiktionary.org/wiki/[word]`. This could also be a
phrase, but 'word' is used throughout for simplicity. An
`io_options.IOOptions` object created with `audio_out_mode = NO_OUTPUT`
(the default) is also passed to the wrapper to specify that audio files
should not yet be downloaded.

2. The program downloads information about each word and audio file.
Summary information is stored in files with names specified by the user in
the `output_audios_filename` parameter (one record per audio file) and the
`output_words_filename` parameter (one record per word). Users can review
these files as well as the HTML and wikitext for each word and audio file
to determine which audio files they want to keep. Users can rerun steps (1)
and (2) as desired and pass a custom sort function to the wrapper to make
selection easier (i.e., so the user can sort by the desired features and
then just select the first word after sorting (`word_counter == 1` in the
output file), assuming the first word meets the desired criteria. The
package creates potentially useful attributes for each file such as
`headword` (a boolean indicator that the audio pronounces only the word,
rather than an expression containing the word), and probable licenses,
authors, and attributions (when different from the author) in the
`prob_licenses`, `prob_authors`, and `prob_attribs` attributes,
respectively. See `AudioFile` and `AudioFile.parse_audio_wikitext()`
documentation for additional details, but note that if the default
parser is used, the parsing may not extract the information correctly, and
users should review the wikitext and/or HTML in Step 4 to confirm the
license, author, and/or attribution was extracted correctly.

3. The user can then take the output file that is one record per audio
file and set the `request_status` column to `Y` or `N` to indicate
whether the desired file should be downloaded. This can be passed back to
the wrapper. The user can also specify `output_wikitext_filename` when
calling the wrapper and the wikitext for all requested audios will be
output to a single file, along with the probable authors, probable
licenses, and probable attributions extracted by the parser.

4. The wrapper will still not download the audio files (because the
`io_options.IOOptions` object still has `audio_out_mode = NOOUTPUT`).
However, the wrapper will now copy the HTML and wikitext output for the
selected files to the `fnsphtmlr` and `fnspwtxtr` directories of the
`output_dir` specified for more thorough review by the user. The
`output_wikitext_filename` described in Step 3 will also be generated for
review.

5. The user can now update the `audio_out_mode` attribute of the
`io_options.IOOptions` object to either `OVERWRITE` (to overwrite if the
requested audio file already exists) or `NO_OVERWRITE` and rerun the
wrapper. The requested files will then be downloaded. The download status
for each file is stored in the generated summary files specified by
`output_audios_filename` and `output_words_filename`.

# Example (with wrapper function)
```
from wikwork import wrapper, page_media, io_options
import logging

# set up the logger to print to the console
logger = logging.getLogger('wikwork')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
ch = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - '
                              '%(levelname)s - %(message)s')
ch.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(ch)

my_headers = {
    'User-Agent': '(wikwork Python package) (email or phone of user)'
}

# Sleeping 8 seconds after every API call makes the program run quite slow,
# but this will keep the number of requests per hour under 500. Users can
# request a personal API key and pass it in `my_headers` above to get a
# higher rate limit.
io_opts = io_options.IOOptions(
     output_dir='cache_output/de',
     project='Wiktionary',
     sleep_time=8,
     headers=my_headers)

# Sort first by pronunciation not from Austria, then by whether the audio
# is likely a pronuncation of only the headword, then by preferred license
# status, then by pronunciation (as German words ending in '-ig' often
# have two variants recorded, so this preferentially selects those
# sounding like '-ik' [IPA: -ɪk] over '-isch' [IPA: -ɪç]).

pref_license_set = set(['cc-by-sa 4.0', 'cc-by-sa-4.0'])

def my_sort(x: page_media.AudioFile):
     return (not x.filename.startswith('De-at-'),
     x.prob_headword,
     (x.prob_licenses is not None and
       len(set(x.prob_licenses) & pref_license_set)>0),
     re.search('ɪk/', x.wikitext) is not None)

# can use the wrapper, (de_input.txt has a column with header = 'Word'
# and then rows with values given by input_list).

input_list = ['Kind','Montag','helfen','Zahl','Wunderbar!',
              'rot','sonnig','zum Beispiel']

# Step 1 (of example workflow given above)
res = wrapper.words_wrapper(
     input_words_filename=f'de_input.txt',
     headword_lang_code='de',
     audio_html_lang_code='en',
     io_options=io_opts,

     sort_key=my_sort,
     output_words_filename='de_output_words.txt',
     output_audios_filename='de_output_audios.txt',
     )

#     If users does not want to download audio files, a single wrapper call
#     is sufficient, no need to continue. Otherwise...
#
# ... Step 2 and 3 of example workflow, user copies 'de_output_audios.txt'
#     to 'de_input_audios_req.txt' and sets `request_status` column to
#     'Y' or 'N' for each file to specify whether or not the file should be
#     downloaded. For example, load the text file into a spreadsheet,
#     filter by `word_counter == 1`, and set to 'Y' when the filename does
#     not start with 'De-at-' and the probable licenses / authors are as
#     desired.

res = wrapper.words_wrapper(
     input_words_filename=f'de_input.txt',
     headword_lang_code='de',
     audio_html_lang_code='en',
     io_options=io_opts,
     input_words_column_name='Word',
     fetch_word_page=True,
     fetch_audio_info=True,
     sort_key=my_sort,
     input_audio_reqs='de_input_audio_req.txt'
     output_words_filename='de_output_words_2.txt',
     output_audios_filename='de_output_audios_2.txt',
     output_wikitext_filename='de_wiki_2.txt'
     )

# ... User does final QC described in Step 3 and 4 of workflow. Once
#     user has made final decision on audio files to download,
#     user updates `audio_out_mode` to indicate audio should be
#     downloaded, and the wrapper is rerun to perform the download.

io_opts.audio_out_mode = io_options.AudioOutMode.NO_OVERWRITE

res = wrapper.words_wrapper(
     input_words_filename=f'de_input.txt',
     headword_lang_code='de',
     audio_html_lang_code='en',
     io_options=io_opts,
     input_words_column_name='Word',
     fetch_word_page=True,
     fetch_audio_info=True,
     sort_key=my_sort,
     input_audio_reqs='de_input_audio_req.txt'
     output_words_filename='de_output_words_3.txt',
     output_audios_filename='de_output_audios_3.txt',
     output_wikitext_filename='de_wiki_3.txt'
     )
```

# Example (brief excerpt without wrapper function)
```
# ... or instead of using the wrapper, create Headword objects directly ...
# (One could also make german.GermanWord objects instead of Headword
# objects. The difference is GermanWord objects will parse the wikitext of
# the headword page for grammar information. See german.GermanWord for
# details.)

res2 = []
for word in input_list:
    word_info = page_media.Headword(headword=word, lang_code='de')
    if word_info.valid_input:
        # need to get revision info first
        word_info.fetch_revision_info(io_options=io_opts)
        # optionally get word_page (https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/foo)
        word_info.fetch_word_page(io_options=io_opts)
        # optionally get list of audio files and their info from from
        #    (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:audio_filename.ogg)
        word_info.fetch_audio_info(io_options=io_opts,
            audio_html_lang_code='en', sort_key=my_sort)
        # ... whatever else user wants to do ...
        res2.append(word_info)
```

# Other Considerations
1. The following page has other useful points to consider when deciding
whether or how to use downloaded media:
    https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Reusing_content_outside_Wikimedia

2. Users should familiarize themselves with wikitext and especially
templates.  For example, the file-namespace pages with license/author
information are typically quite small (<100 characters). The 'Template:'
namespace on Wikimedia Commons™ can be used to find information about a
template (ie, strings enclosed in two braces '{{...}}'. For example,
information about the template '{{cc-zero}}' can be found at
    https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:cc-zero (which redirects to
    https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Cc-zero).
One would expect these templates to not change much over time (the one
linked above was changed only four times from when it was protected in
October 2013 to February 2024).

3. There may be other methods of retrieving license information, perhaps
through MediaWiki™ action APIs or Wikidata™. For action APIs, it does seem
to be possible with images.

4. Determining which template parameters to assign to which attributes was
based on researching templates at the time of writing the function that
parses such templates. Templates are not retrieved 'in real time' by the
package at the time of function execution. Information in the docstrings of
the relevant `GermanEntry` or `PolishEntry` objects indicate the source
parameter for all such attributes so that users can verify at the time of
program execution, if desired, the meaning of the parameter has not
changed.

5. Users planning a very large number of requests might be better off using
a database dump.

# Known issues
The media list REST API call for the Spanish Wiktionary returns information
about very few audio files compared to what is available on the headword
page.  Presumably whatever parser the REST API call uses to extract the
media list doesn't recognize the template the files are nested in.
