# Inspiration

On a cold morning while enduring the usual Dutch weather, I had a conversation with my PhD supervisor [Pedro Braga Groszewicz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=05NlC3gAAAAJ&hl=en) about deconvoluting Lorentzian and Gaussian areas from a complex 1D 17O MAS ss-NMR spectrum. He explained the concept of Voigt and Pseudo-Voigt functions and how they could help with this deconvolution. He mentioned [MestreNova](https://mestrelab.com/main-product/mnova) software, which indeed offered a solution to my problem. However, I was not just interested in the solution but also the black box behind it.

So I embarked on a journey to unravel this black box and didn't stop until I discovered how it worked. This journey led to the creation of this package.

# Credits 

I would like to thank the creator [NMRglue](https://github.com/jjhelmus/nmrglue) for making it possible to work directly with [Bruker's](https://www.bruker.com/en.html) folder. Also, a special thanks to the creator(s) of [LMFit's](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/builtin_models.html) built-in models -- their content was pivotal in understanding the concept of the Pseudo-Voigt function and its parameters. A special shoutout to [matplotlib] (https://matplotlib.org/) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/).
