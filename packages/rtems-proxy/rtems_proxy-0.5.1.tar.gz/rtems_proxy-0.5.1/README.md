# rtems_proxy

Support for a K8S proxy container in controlling and monitoring RTEMS EPICS IOCs

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/epics-containers/rtems-proxy>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install rtems-proxy`
Releases        | <https://github.com/epics-containers/rtems-proxy/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from rtems_proxy import __version__

print(f"Hello rtems_proxy {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:


```
python -m rtems_proxy --version
```
