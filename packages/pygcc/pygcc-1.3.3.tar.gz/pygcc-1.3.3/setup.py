The documentation is continually evolving, and more examples and tutorials will gradually be added (feel free to\nrequest features or examples; see [Contributing](#contributing) below).\n\n## Installation\n\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pygcc.svg?style=flat)](https://pypi.org/project/pygcc/)\n[![Compatible Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pygcc.svg?style=flat)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygcc/)\n[![pygcc downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/pygcc.svg?style=flat)](https://pypistats.org/packages/pygcc)\n\n```bash\n$ pip install pygcc\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nCheck out the documentation for galleries of examples [General Usage](https://pygcc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Example_1.html), \n[Integration with GWB](https://pygcc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Example_2.html) and [Integration with EQ3/6](https://pygcc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Example_3.html). \nIf you would prefer to flip through notebooks on Bitbucket, these same examples can be found in the folder [`docs/`](https://bitbucket.org/Tutolo-RTG/pygcc/src/master/docs/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing?
