[Installation](https://openml.github.io/openml-python/main/#how-to-get-openml-for-python) | [Documentation](https://openml.github.io/openml-python) | [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/openml/openml-python/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)

OpenML-Python provides an easy-to-use and straightforward Python interface for [OpenML](http://openml.org), an online platform for open science collaboration in machine learning.
It can download or upload data from OpenML, such as datasets and machine learning experiment results.

## :joystick: Minimal Example

Use the following code to get the [credit-g](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active&id=31) [dataset](https://docs.openml.org/concepts/data/):

```python
import openml

dataset = openml.datasets.get_dataset("credit-g") # or by ID get_dataset(31)
X, y, categorical_indicator, attribute_names = dataset.get_data(target="class")
```

Get a [task](https://docs.openml.org/concepts/tasks/) for [supervised classification on credit-g](https://www.openml.org/search?type=task&id=31&source_data.data_id=31):

```python
import openml

task = openml.tasks.get_task(31)
dataset = task.get_dataset()
X, y, categorical_indicator, attribute_names = dataset.get_data(target=task.target_name)
# get splits for the first fold of 10-fold cross-validation
train_indices, test_indices = task.get_train_test_split_indices(fold=0)
```

Use an [OpenML benchmarking suite](https://docs.openml.org/concepts/benchmarking/) to get a curated list of machine-learning tasks:
```python
import openml

suite = openml.study.get_suite("amlb-classification-all")  # Get a curated list of tasks for classification
for task_id in suite.tasks:
    task = openml.tasks.get_task(task_id)
```

## :magic_wand: Installation

OpenML-Python is supported on Python 3.8 - 3.13 and is available on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

You can install OpenML-Python with:

```bash
pip install openml
```
