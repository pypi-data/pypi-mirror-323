# ü§î LLM-Reasoner

Transform any LLM into a methodical thinker that excels at systematic reasoning, featuring:

- Support for multiple LLM providers through LiteLLM
- Structured reasoning with confidence scores and self-reflection
- Command-line interface for quick reasoning tasks
- Interactive Streamlit UI for visual exploration
- Easy integration with existing Python applications
- Automated self-reflection and quality scoring
- Support for mathematical notation using LaTeX
- Methodical step-by-step problem solving

## üöÄ Getting Started

Install LLM-Reasoner with pip:
```bash
pip install llm-reasoner
```

Configure your API keys:
```bash
# Using OpenAI? Pop this in:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Team Google? Here you go:
export VERTEX_PROJECT="your-project"
export VERTEX_LOCATION="your-location"

# Claude fan? Got you covered:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## üéÆ Quick Play

Try these commands to get started:

```bash
# Check out what models you can use
llm-reasoner models

# Ask it something cool
llm-reasoner reason "Why do planes stay up in the air?"

# Want a nice UI to play with?
llm-reasoner ui
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Using It In Your Code

Here's the simplest way to use LLM-Reasoner:

```python
from reasonchain import ReasonChain
import asyncio

async def main():
    chain = ReasonChain()
    async for step in chain.generate("How does evolution work?"):
        print(f"ü§î Step {step.number}: {step.title}")
        print(step.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Want more control? Here's an advanced example:

```python
chain = ReasonChain(
    model="gpt-4",                         # Pick your favorite model
    max_tokens=1000,                       # Let it think deeper
    temperature=0.3,                       # Control creativity
    prompt_template="Let's explore: {prompt}"  # Make it your own
)

# Get all the details about its thinking process
async for step in chain.generate_with_metadata("How do computers learn?"):
    print(f"üí≠ Step {step.number}: {step.title}")
    print(f"üéØ Confidence: {step.confidence}") 
    print(f"‚è±Ô∏è Thinking time: {step.thinking_time}s")
    print(step.content)
```

## üîß Custom Models

You can register custom models with LLM-Reasoner using the model registry:

```python
from reasonchain import model_registry

# Register a custom model
model_registry.register_model(
    name="my-custom-model",
    provider="custom-provider",
    context_window=4096  # Optional
)

# Use your custom model
chain = ReasonChain(model="my-custom-model")
```

This allows you to use any LLM provider supported by LiteLLM, not just the default providers. See [LiteLLM's documentation](https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/providers) for the full list of supported providers.

## üåü Features in Detail

Each reasoning step includes:
- Step number (keeping things organized)
- Clear title (what it's pondering)
- Detailed thoughts (the good stuff)
- Confidence score (how sure it is)
- Thinking time (we track speed too!)
- Timestamp (when each thought happened)
- Next action (what it's planning)

## üé® Interactive UI

Launch the visual interface with:
```bash
llm-reasoner ui
```

The UI provides:
- Model selection
- Parameter adjustment
- Real-time reasoning visualization
- Interactive exploration

## Development

To contribute to LLM-Reasoner:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install development dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
3. Run tests: `pytest`
