# BrightEyes-FFS

A toolbox for analysing Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Fluorescence Fluctuation Spectroscopy (FFS) data with array detectors.
The fcs module contains libraries for:

* Calculating autocorrelations and cross-correlations of raw FCS/FFS data (i.e. photon counts vs. time)
* Fitting correlations to various 2D and 3D diffusion models
* Calibration-free FCS/FFS analysis such as circular-scanning FCS and iMSD analysis
* Miscellaneous tools

The fcs_gui module contains libraries for:

* Storing and loading FCS/FFS analysis sessions, as used in the GUI

The dataio module contains libraries for:

* Fitting various models to data (polynomial, Gaussian, power law, etc.)
* Stokes-Einstein relation
* Save/load 2D arrays to/from .csv files
* Save data to .tiff file
* Miscellaneous tools
