# Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use `nextpipe`. Each example typically makes use of other apps that get executed in the example pipeline. If these apps are not already available via [community-apps](https://github.com/nextmv-io/community-apps) (via CLI: `nextmv community clone -a <app-id>`), you can find them in the `./apps` directory.
