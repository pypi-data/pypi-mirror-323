## Solution 2: Status for predictions and prediction import

After you have clicked **"Send data to CHAP âž”"**, you will be redirected to the "CHAP Core status" page.

## CHAP Core status page

At this page, the status of the prediction will be shown. See the image below.

When the information about the status disappears (as shown below), the prediction is completed. Click **"Import latest prediction"** to see the result.

## Import prediction page

You will then be redirected to the "Import prediction" page, where you can import the prediction into DHIS2. At the top, you will see a chart, as shown below, describing what you are about to import.
