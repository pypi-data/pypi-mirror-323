Installation and getting started
===================================

Requirements
------------
The chap-core Python package requires Python 3.10 or higher, and is tested to work on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Most of the built-in forecasting models in CHAP require Docker to run, and we recommend also using Docker to setup chap-core for most use-cases (see below). The current builtin-models are not resource-intensive and one should be fine with 4 GB of RAM.

Installation of chap-core
---------------------------

Installation of CHAP depends on how you want to use CHAP. If you are developing custom models or integrating external forecasting models with CHAP, you should install the chap-core Python package, which can be done easily using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install chap-core

We recommend installing chap-core inside a Python `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ to avoid conflicts with other Python packages. On Windows, the best approach is to use Conda to manage environments. If you don't have Conda, you can install Miniconda,
(a minimal installer for Conda) from https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#latest-miniconda-installer-links

- Windows: After installation open "Anaconda Prompt". Search for "Anaconda Prompt" in the Windows Start menu.
- Linux: Conda should work in your default terminal after installation.

Using Conda, you can create an environment like this before running `pip install chap-core`:

    $ conda create -n chap-core python=3.11

    $ conda activate chap-core

To verify that the installation worked, check that you have the `chap` and `chap-cli` commands available in yor terminal. For instance, typing chap-cli should give something like:

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: chap-cli COMMAND

Local or server setup with docker
----------------------------------

If you want to run models that are already available with CHAP locally on a computer or on a server, we recommend setting up CHAP using docker. A guide for setting up CHAP using Docker will be provided here shortly.


Setting up CHAP inside an LXD container
----------------------------------------

It is also possible to run a full installation of CHAP inside an LXD container. For an example setup, see the `CHAP LXD container setup <https://github.com/dhis2-chap/infrastructure>`_.
