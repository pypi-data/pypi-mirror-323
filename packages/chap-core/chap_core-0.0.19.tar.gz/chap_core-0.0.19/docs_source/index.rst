Climate Health Analytics Platform (CHAP)
==============================================================

CHAP is a platform for forecasting and for assessing forecasts of climate-sensitive health outcomes.
In the early phase, the focus is on vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue.

The platform can perform data parsing, data integration, forecasting based on any of
multiple supported models, automatic brokering of compatible models for a given prediction context and robust forecast assessment and method comparison.

This documentation contains technical information about installing and using CHAP. For more general information about the project, we refer to `the CHAP project wiki <https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core/wiki>`_. The documentation here is divided into sections referring to different use-cases:

----

**Full installation and integration with DHIS2**

For users who want to fully install CHAP locally or on a server, e.g. to integrate with DHIS2, we recommend 
:doc:`setting up CHAP with docker compose <docker-compose-doc>` and :doc:`using the Prediction app <prediction-app/prediction-app>`.

-----

**Integrating external or custom models with CHAP**

For users who want to develop custom forecasting models and run or benchmark these through CHAP, or to simply evaluate external models on small example datasets, we recommend :ref:`installing the chap-core Python package <installation>` and 
folowing the guides on :ref:`integrating external models <external_models_overview>` and :ref:`developing custom models <developing_custom_models>`.

-----

**Using CHAP as a library**

For users who want to use CHAP as a library, we refer to the tutorials and API documentation (see the menu).
