A powerful tool for extracting, scoring, and assigning information nuggets from text using LLMs.

## 📟 Installation

### Create Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n nuggetizer python=3.10
conda activate nuggetizer
```

### Pip Installation

```bash
pip install nuggetizer
```

### Development Installation

For development or the latest features, install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/castorini/nuggetizer.git
cd nuggetizer
pip install -e .
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI credentials. For Azure OpenAI (default for GPT models):

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_BASE=your_azure_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=your_api_version
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Or for OpenAI API:

```bash
OPEN_AI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use nuggetizer:

```python
from nuggetizer.core.types import Query, Document, Request
from nuggetizer.models.nuggetizer import Nuggetizer
from nuggetizer.models.scorer import NuggetScorer
from nuggetizer.models.assigner import NuggetAssigner

# Create a sample request
query = Query(qid="1", text="What are the main features of Python?")
documents = [
    Document(
        docid="1",
        segment="""Python is a high-level programming language known for its 
        simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms 
        including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming."""
    ),
    Document(
        docid="2",
        segment="""Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991."""
    ),
    Document(
        docid="3",
        segment="""Python is widely used in web development, data analysis, 
        artificial intelligence, and scientific computing."""
    ),
]
request = Request(query=query, documents=documents)

# Initialize components (API keys and configuration are loaded automatically)
nuggetizer = Nuggetizer(model="gpt-4o")  # Uses Azure OpenAI by default for GPT models
scorer = NuggetScorer(model="gpt-4o")
assigner = NuggetAssigner(model="gpt-4o")

# Process the request
nuggets, _ = nuggetizer.process(request)
scored_nuggets = scorer.score(nuggets)
assigned_nuggets = assigner.assign(documents[0].segment, scored_nuggets)

# Print results
for nugget in assigned_nuggets:
    print(f"Nugget: {nugget.text}")
    print(f"Importance: {nugget.importance}")
    print(f"Assignment: {nugget.assignment}\n")
```

## 🛠️ Components

1. **Nuggetizer**: Extracts atomic information nuggets from text
2. **NuggetScorer**: Scores nuggets based on their importance
3. **NuggetAssigner**: Assigns nuggets to specific text passages

### Processing Pool and RAG Answer Files

To process a pool file (`pool.jsonl`) and a RAG answer file (`ragnarok.jsonl`), follow these steps:

1. First, generate nuggets and score them:
```bash
# Extract nuggets
python3 scripts/create_nuggets.py --input_file pool.jsonl --output_file nuggets.jsonl --log_level 1

# Score the nuggets
python3 scripts/score_nuggets.py --input_file nuggets.jsonl --output_file scored_nuggets.jsonl
```

2. For RAG answers, we assume they take on the format laid out by the wonderful [TREC 2024 RAG Track](https://trec-rag.github.io/annoucements/2024-track-guidelines/):

```json
{
    "run_id": "ragnarok",
    "topic_id": "2027497", # query_id
    "topic": "how often should you take your toddler to the potty when potty training", # query
    "references": [ # top-k segments returned used from the retrieval step. We have k equals to 20 segments for this example.

    "response_length": 192, 
    "answer": [ # RAG answer broken into sentences with each answer sentence grounding information from the index mentioned in references.
            {"text": "The frequency with which you should take your toddler to the potty depends on their readiness for potty training.", "citations": [0, 1, 12, 13, 19]},

            {"text": "If they are reluctant to use the potty, don't force them.", "citations": [6, 8]}, 
            {"text": "Other sources suggest that toddlers should be taken to the potty every two hours, whether they have to go or not.", "citations": [14, 15]}, 
            {"text": "This includes first thing in the morning, before leaving the house, and before naps and bedtime.", "citations": [14, 15]}, 
            {"text": "Some sources recommend taking toddlers to the potty every 30 minutes to an hour.", "citations": [9, 11, 17]}, 
            {"text": "This is to increase the chances of them peeing in the potty instead of on the floor.", "citations": [9, 11]}, 
            {"text": "It is important to keep in mind that every toddler is different, and their potty training journey will be unique to them.", "citations": [0, 4]}, 
            {"text": "It is recommended that you let your toddler lead the way and be gentle throughout the process, as their self-esteem can be fragile during this time.", "citations": [0, 1]}
        ]
}
```
To *easily* generate answers in this format, consider using [Ragnarök](https://github.com/castorini/ragnarok).
Let's now assign the nuggets to the RAG answers:

```bash
# Assign nuggets to RAG answers
python3 scripts/assign_nuggets.py \
    --nugget_file scored_nuggets.jsonl \
    --answer_file ragnarok.jsonl \
    --output_file final_assignments.jsonl

# Calculate metrics
python3 scripts/calculate_metrics.py \
    --input_file final_assignments.jsonl \
    --output_file metrics.jsonl
```

The final output file (`final_assignments.jsonl`) will contain:
- query: The original query
- qid: Query ID
- answer_text: Full answer text
- response_length: Response length
- run_id: Run ID (derived from the RAG answer filename)
- nuggets: Nuggets with their importance labels and assignments

The final metrics file (`metrics.jsonl`) will contain:
- Per-response metrics:
  - strict_vital_score: Score counting only full support for vital nuggets
  - strict_all_score: Score counting only full support for all nuggets
  - vital_score: Score counting full (1.0) and partial (0.5) support for vital nuggets
  - all_score: Score counting full (1.0) and partial (0.5) support for all nuggets
- Global mean metrics across all responses

### Advanced Configuration

While the default configuration works out of the box, you can customize the behavior:

```python
# Custom window size and mode
nuggetizer = Nuggetizer(
    model="gpt-4o",
    window_size=10,  # Process more documents at once
    stride=10,        # Overlap between windows
    max_nuggets=30   # Maximum number of nuggets to extract
)

# Custom scoring mode
scorer = NuggetScorer(
    model="gpt-4o",
    mode=NuggetScoreMode.VITAL_OKAY,
    window_size=20
)

# Custom assignment mode
assigner = NuggetAssigner(
    model="gpt-4o",
    mode=NuggetAssignMode.SUPPORT_GRADE_3,  # 3-level support grading
    window_size=15
)

# Using non-Azure OpenAI models
nuggetizer = Nuggetizer(model="claude-3")  # Will use regular OpenAI API
```
