## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2](https://github.com/denehoffman/laddu/releases/tag/py-laddu-v0.2.2) - 2025-01-24

### Fixed

- corrected signature in methods that read from AmpTools trees
- fixed python examples and readme paths
- modify tests and workflows to new structure

### Other

- bump version
- *(py-laddu)* release v0.2.1
- force version bump
- fix python docs to use "extensions" rather than "likelihoods"
- *(py-laddu)* release v0.2.0
- release all crates manually
- release-plz does not like the way I've set up the workspace. I've looked at conda/rattler for some inspiration, but I might need to manually publish each crate once to get the ball rolling
- add rust version to py-laddu
- complete python integration to new py-laddu crate
- major rewrite
