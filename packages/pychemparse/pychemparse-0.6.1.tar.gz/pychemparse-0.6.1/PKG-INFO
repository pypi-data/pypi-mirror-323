## About

Package for extracting the data from ORCA .out, GPAW .txt files and many more.

This package is not only made to extract the data from premade extraction patterns but is mostly aimed toward the creation of user extraction patterns from the unknown blocks, to warranty the extraction from the outputs from the different ORCA versions.

It prevents the extraction of the data from incorrect parts of the output and creates the marking of the document.

## Python

Example of the pandas.DataFrame with the extracted data, both premade and created by a user. See examples for more details.
