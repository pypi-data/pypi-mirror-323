# Security Considerations

This document outlines important security considerations when using ENcrypt.

## Understanding the Security Model

ENcrypt employs matrix-based encryption with the following features:

- High-precision arithmetic operations
- Matrix-based transformations
- Periodic decimal expansions
- Custom alphabet support

---

## Security Recommendations

### Key Selection

- **Key Size**:  
  Use larger keys for better security. The minimum recommended key size is 4 digits, though it should be adjusted based on your computational resources.

- **Key Management**:  
  Ensure secure storage of keys, implement regular key rotation, and enforce proper access controls.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Error Handling

Always include proper error handling in your implementation:

```python
try:
    encryptor = ENcrypt(key)
    encrypted = encryptor.encrypt(message)
except EncryptionError as e:
    # Handle error appropriately
    logger.error(f"Encryption failed: {e}")
```

### Input Validation

Validate all inputs to ensure secure operations:

```python
def validate_message(message: str, alphabet: str) -> bool:
    return all(char.lower() in alphabet.lower() for char in message)
```

### Secure Configuration

Example of a secure configuration:

```python
import logging
from encryptlib import ENcrypt

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Secure initialization
try:
    encryptor = ENcrypt(
        value=49,  # Large key
        alphabet="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 "  # Custom alphabet
    )
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Initialization failed: {e}")
```

## Known Limitations

### Mathematical Constraints

- Matrix invertibility requirements
- Periodic decimal expansion patterns
- Computational complexity considerations

### Implementation Limitations

- Higher memory usage with large messages
- Performance bottlenecks
- Restrictions on character sets

---

## Best Practices

### Application Security

- Enforce access controls and monitor usage
- Conduct regular security audits
- Implement secure key management and communication channels

### Operational Security

- Keep software updated and monitor for vulnerabilities
- Develop an incident response plan
- Maintain documentation and provide staff training

### Development Practices

- Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing
- Perform vulnerability assessments
- Keep documentation up-to-date

---

## Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment

- Verify key generation process
- Implement robust error handling and input validation
- Set up logging and monitoring
- Document security procedures

### Regular Maintenance

- Review and update security configurations
- Conduct periodic audits
- Monitor system activity
- Rotate encryption keys regularly
