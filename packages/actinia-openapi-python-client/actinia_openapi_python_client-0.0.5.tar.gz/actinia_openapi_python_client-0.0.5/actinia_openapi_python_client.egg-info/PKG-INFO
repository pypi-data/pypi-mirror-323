    ## Actinia - The GRASS GIS REST API

    **Actinia** is an open source REST API for scalable, distributed, high
    performance processing of geographical data that uses GRASS GIS for
    computational tasks.

    It provides a REST API to process satellite images, time series of satellite
    images, arbitrary raster data with geographical relations and vector data.

    The REST interface allows to access, manage and manipulate the GRASS GIS
    database via HTTP GET,PUT,POST and DELETE requests and to process raster,
    vector and time series data located in a persistent GRASS GIS database.
    **Actinia** allows the processing of cloud based data, for example all Landsat
    4-8 scenes as well as all Sentinel2A scenes in an ephemeral databases. The
    computational results of ephemeral processing are available via object storage
    as GeoTIFF files.
