**Funding**
-   EPFL, IBOIS - PhD Thesis
-   NCCR Digital Fabrication

**History**
-   The first version was written during the PhD 8928 thesis of Petras Vestartas called: Design-to-Fabrication Workflow for Raw-Sawn-Timber using Joinery Solver, 2017-2021.
-   The translation from C# to C++ was started during the funding of NCCR in two steps. A - standalone C++ version of the joinery solver and B - integration to COMPAS framework (Python Pybind11).
-   Video recordings were made as part of [EDX platform](https://www.edx.org/learn/architecture/ecole-polytechnique-federale-de-lausanne-advanced-timber-plate-structural-design?index=product&queryID=dcf82d4230ab5ed1beabb6d349576a6e&position=1&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete).
-  Currently it is being developed on free time.
