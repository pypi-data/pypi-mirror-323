# Management API Python Client

## Overview

The Management API Python Client is an early-stage project
designed to simplify interactions with the Contensis Management API.
This software provides tools for creating, updating, and managing content programmatically.
It can support workflows such as:

- Content migration: Import content in bulk,
  whether for one-off migrations or recurring scheduled tasks.
- Integration: Connect with external systems for content operations.

While the client is intended for use outside a website context,
it may also be adapted for use within web projects if necessary.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This software is incomplete and still under development.
It should be considered unreliable and is not ready for production use.
Bugs and missing functionality are likely.
Use with caution in experimental or non-critical environments.

## How It Works

The Management API Python Client simplifies integration with the Contensis Management API
by acting as a wrapper around the core HTTP services.
Key features include:

- Security Handling: Manages authentication and token handling.
- Data Parsing: Simplifies working with API responses by automating common parsing tasks.
- Abstraction: Eliminates the need for direct management of raw HTTP requests,
  making development faster and more efficient.

This client is intended to reduce the complexity of building and
maintaining integrations with Contensis,
but its current state may not yet meet all your needs or expectations.
