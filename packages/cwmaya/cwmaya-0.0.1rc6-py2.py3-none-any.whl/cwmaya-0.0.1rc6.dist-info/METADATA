# Maya submitter plugin

Maya plugin node to set up task dependency submissions.

## Install from PyPi
*NOTE: If you'd like to contribute or develop templates, skip to [Install from GitHub](#install-from-github) section*

**Install the latest version.**
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade cwmaya --target=$HOME/CoreWeave/maya
```

**Then setup the Maya module.** 

```bash
python3 $HOME/CoreWeave/maya/cwmaya/post_install.py
```


## Install from GitHub

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ConductorTechnologies/cwmaya.git
cd cwmaya
pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt --target=$HOME/Sandbox/maya
python3 $HOME/Sandbox/maya/cwmaya/post_install.py
```

Open the Plugin Manager and load **CoreWeave.py**.

To set up a job, choose **CoreWeave->Storm Window** from the main Maya menu bar.

## Install the Desktop app

The desktop app is a standalone application that allows you to visualize graphs created by the Maya plugin. It is not required to submit jobs, but it is extremely useful.

To install the desktop app in development mode, go to the repo and follow the [instructions in the README](https://github.com/ConductorTechnologies/cioapp). 

Alternatively, go to the [releases](https://github.com/ConductorTechnologies/cioapp/releases) page and download a build for your platform. 

*NOTE: Some M series Macs may have trouble running prebuilt versions of the app. If it doesn't work, you can run your own build, or work in development mode. [See the README](https://github.com/ConductorTechnologies/cioapp) for details.* 

## Usage

* To learn the system with a fake job, see the [busywork tutorial](./doc/busywork_tutorial.md).
* To learn about writing templates, see the [template docs](./doc/templates.md).
* For a comprehensive reference, see the [reference](./doc/reference.md) documentation.

## Have fun!
