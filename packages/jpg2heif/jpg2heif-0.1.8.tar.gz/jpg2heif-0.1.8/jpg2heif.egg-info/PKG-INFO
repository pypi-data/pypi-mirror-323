# JPG to HEIF Converter

This project allows you to freely convert JPG images to HEIF format. HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) is a more efficient image format in terms of storage and quality compared to traditional formats like JPG.

## Why HEIF?

HEIF, as the name suggests, is a high-efficiency image format. Not only does it offer smaller file sizes compared to JPG, but it also provides better image quality. This makes it an excellent choice for anyone looking to save storage space without compromising on image quality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Devasy23/JPG2HEIF
    ```


2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On Unix or MacOS:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Using the CLI

To convert a JPG image to HEIF using the command line interface, use the following command:

```bash
jpg2heif file file.jpg file.heic
```

You can also convert a folder of images or a zip file:

```bash
jpg2heif folder input_folder output_folder
jpg2heif zip input.zip output.zip
```

To benchmark the conversion algorithm:

```bash
jpg2heif file file.jpg file.heic --benchmark
```

To compare SSIM index of other converted images with the original:

```bash
jpg2heif file original.jpg --compare converted1.heic converted2.heic
```

### Using the Streamlit App

To convert a JPG image to HEIF using the Streamlit app, use the following command:

```bash
