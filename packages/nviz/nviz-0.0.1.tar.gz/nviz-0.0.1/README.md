This project focuses on ingesting a set of [TIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF) images as [OME-Zarr](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9980008/) or [OME-TIFF](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2005-6-5-r47).
Each input image set[^1^](#image_set_ref) are organized by channel and z-slices which form four dimensional (4D) microscopy data.
These 4D microscopy data contain information for biological objects (such as organoids).

We read the output with [Napari](https://napari.org/dev/index.html), which provides a way to analyze and understand the 3D image data.

> <a name="image_set_ref">1.</a> __Image set__ is loosely defined and changes depending on the context of the data.
> Here it represents a set of images in multiple dimensions that contain information regarding the same sample.
> Each image in an imageset is paired data and must be related as such.
