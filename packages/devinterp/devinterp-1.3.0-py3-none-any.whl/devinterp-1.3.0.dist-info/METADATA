## A Python Library for Developmental Interpretability Research

DevInterp is a python library for conducting research on developmental interpretability, a novel AI safety research agenda rooted in Singular Learning Theory (SLT). DevInterp proposes tools for detecting, locating, and ultimately _controlling_ the development of structure over training.

[Read more about developmental interpretability](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TjaeCWvLZtEDAS5Ex/towards-developmental-interpretability).


> :warning: This library is still in early development. Don't expect things to work on a first attempt. We are actively working on improving the library and adding new features. 

## Installation

 To install `devinterp`, simply run `pip install devinterp`. (Note: This has PyTorch as a dependency.)

### Minimal Example

```python

from devinterp.slt.sampler import  sample, LLCEstimator
from devinterp.optim import SGLD
from devinterp.utils import default_nbeta

# Assuming you have a PyTorch Model assigned to model, and DataLoader assigned to trainloader
llc_estimator = LLCEstimator(..., nbeta=default_nbeta(trainloader))
sample(model, trainloader, ..., callbacks = [llc_estimator])

llc_mean = llc_estimator.get_results()["llc/mean"]

```

## Known Issues

- LLC Estimation is currently more of an art than a science. It will take some time and pain to get it work reliably.

If you run into issues not mentioned here, please first check the github issues, then ask in [the DevInterp Discord](https://discord.gg/UwjWKCZZYR), and only then make a new github issue.

## Optional Dependencies

DevInterp offers additional visualization functionalities that are not included in the base installation. To enable these features, install the package with the `vis` extra:

```sh
pip install devinterp[vis]
```

This will install `plotly`, which is required for the visualization utilities provided in `vis_utils.py`.
