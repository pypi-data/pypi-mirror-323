People Handler

This is a :term:`handler` to manage "people" in the DB.

    """
    Base class and default implementation for the "people"
    :term:`handler`.

    This is responsible for managing
    :class:`~wuttjamaican.db.model.base.Person` records, and related
    things.
    """

    def get_person(self, obj, **kwargs):
        """
        Return the :class:`~wuttjamaican.db.model.base.Person`
        associated with the given object, if one can be found.

        This method should accept "any" type of ``obj`` and inspect it
        to determine if/how a person can be found.  It should return
        the "first, most obvious" person in the event that the object
        is associated with multiple people.

        This is a rather fundamental method, in that it is called by
        several other methods, both within this handler as well as
        others.  There is also a shortcut to it, accessible via
        :meth:`wuttjamaican.app.AppHandler.get_person()`.
