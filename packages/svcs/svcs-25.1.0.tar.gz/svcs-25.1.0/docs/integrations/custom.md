# Write Your Own!

Once you've understood how registries and containers interact (see {doc}`../core-concepts` if not), you already know how to write your own integrations!

All you need to do is:

- Give the user an API to create a {class}`~svcs.Registry`s instance and attach it to the application so that the instance lives as long as the application does.

- Ensure that the registry is closed when the application shuts down.
  Either by using the registry as a context manager, or by calling {meth}`~svcs.Registry.close()` or {meth}`~svcs.Registry.aclose()` on your registry instance.
  Or by telling the user to do it themselves -- some web frameworks don't have a way to hook into the application shutdown process.

- Give the user an API to access the registry instance such they can register factories on startup.

- On each request, create a {class}`~svcs.Container` instance and attach it to the request, so it lives as long as the request.

- Ensure that the container instance is closed when the request is done.

- Give the user an API to access the container instance in views, so they can {meth}`~svcs.Container.get()` their services.

  ::: {tip}
  If you need to call a function to extract the container from a request object or similar, consider calling it `svcs_from` like we do in our integrations.

That's it!

If you need inspiration, look at our integrations, like the [one for Flask](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/blob/main/src/svcs/flask.py) that is based on thread locals, the [one for Pyramid](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/blob/main/src/svcs/pyramid.py) that extracts the container from a request object, or the [one for AIOHTTP](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/blob/main/src/svcs/aiohttp.py) that is async.
