# GeoDeep

A fast, easy to use, lightweight Python library for AI object detection in geospatial rasters (GeoTIFFs), with pre-built models included.

## Install

```bash
pip install -U geodeep
```

## Usage

### From the command line

```bash
geodeep [geotiff] [model ID or path to ONNX model]
```

Example:

```bash
geodeep orthophoto.tif cars
```

Here GeoDeep will find cars in the orthophoto and write the result as a GeoJSON file containing the bounding boxes, confidence scores and class labels.

A list of up-to-date model IDs can be retrieved via:

```bash
geodeep --list-models
```

See also `geodeep --help`.

### From Python

```python
from geodeep import detect
bboxes, scores, classes = detect('orthophoto.tif', 'cars')
print(bboxes) # <-- [[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max], [...]]
print(scores) # <-- [score, ...]
print(classes) # <-- [(id: int, label: str), ...]

geojson = detect('orthophoto.tif', 'cars', output_type="geojson")
```

Models by default will be cached in `~/.cache/geodeep`. You can change that with:

```python
from geodeep import models
models.cache_dir = "your/cache/path"
```

All ONNX models are published on https://huggingface.co/datasets/UAV4GEO/GeoDeep-Models

## Creating New Models

Instructions coming soon. The basic idea is to create an ONNX model (see the [retinanet conversion script](https://github.com/uav4geo/GeoDeep/blob/main/geodeep/scripts/convert_retinanet_to_onnx.py)) and possibly make some modifications to GeoDeep to handle different conventions in model architectures via conditional checking.

## Why GeoDeep?

Compared to other software packages (e.g. [Deepness](https://github.com/PUTvision/qgis-plugin-deepness)), GeoDeep relies only on two dependencies, `rasterio` and `onnxruntime`. This makes it simple and lightweight.

## Does this need a GPU?

It does not! Models are tuned to run fast on the CPU.
