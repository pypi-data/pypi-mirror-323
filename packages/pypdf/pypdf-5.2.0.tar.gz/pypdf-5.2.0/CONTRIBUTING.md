Typically you should not send e-mails. E-mails might only reach one person and
it could go into spam or that person might be busy. Please create issues on
GitHub instead.

## Creating Pull Requests

We appreciate if people make PRs, but please be aware that pypdf is used by many
people. That means:

* We rarely make breaking changes and have a [deprecation process](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/deprecations.html).
* New features, especially adding to the public interface, typically need to be
  discussed first.

Before you make bigger changes, open an issue to make the suggestion.
Note which interface changes you want to make.
