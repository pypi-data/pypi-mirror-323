## Installation

This package (discopula) is hosted on PyPi, so for installation follow the following workflow ...

```console
$ pip install discopula
```

Now, you should be all set to use it in a Jupyter Notebook!

Alternatively, if you would like to use it in a project, we recommend you to have a virtual environment for your use of this package, then follow the following workflow. For best practices, it's recommended to use a virtual environment:

1. First, create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.8+ recommended):

```bash
# Create virtual environment
$ python -m venv discopula-env

# Activate virtual environment (Mac/Linux)
$ source discopula-env/bin/activate

# Verify you're in the virtual environment
$ which python
```

2. Install package

```bash
$ pip install discopula
```

3. To deactivate the virtual environment, when done:

```bash
$ deactivate
```

## Documentation

Visit [Read the Docs](https://discopula.readthedocs.org) for the full documentation, including overviews and several examples.

## Examples

For a quick overview, refer to the quick-start example below. More detailed examples for Jupyter Notebooks and beyond (organized by functionality) can be found in our [GitHub repository's examples folder](https://github.com/dmavani25/discopula/tree/master/examples).

### Quick-Start Example

```python
import numpy as np
from discopula import GenericCheckerboardCopula

# Create a sample contingency table
contingency_table = np.array([
    [0, 0, 20],
    [0, 10, 0],
    [20, 0, 0],
    [0, 10, 0],
    [0, 0, 20]
])

# Initialize copula from contingency table
copula = GenericCheckerboardCopula.from_contingency_table(contingency_table)

# Basic properties 
print(f"Shape of probability matrix P: {copula.P.shape}")
print(f"Marginal CDF axis 0: {copula.marginal_cdfs[0]}")
print(f"Marginal CDF axis 1: {copula.marginal_cdfs[1]}")

# Regression calculations
u1, u2 = 0.5, 0.5
print(f"E[U2|U1={u1}] = {copula._calculate_regression(1, 0, u1):.6f}")
print(f"E[U1|U2={u2}] = {copula._calculate_regression(0, 1, u2):.6f}")

# Association measures
print(f"CCRAM 0->1: {copula.calculate_CCRAM(0, 1):.6f}")
print(f"SCCRAM 0->1: {copula.calculate_CCRAM(0, 1, is_scaled=True):.6f}")

# Category predictions
print("\nCategory Prediction Mapping:")
print(copula.get_category_predictions(0, 1))
```

### Quick-Start Example Output 

```text
Shape of probability matrix P: (5, 3)
Marginal CDF axis 0: [0.    0.25  0.375 0.625 0.75  1.   ]
Marginal CDF axis 1: [0.   0.25 0.5  1.  ]
E[U2|U1=0.5] = 0.125000
E[U1|U2=0.5] = 0.500000
CCRAM 0->1: 0.843750
SCCRAM 0->1: 1.000000

Category Predictions: X → Y
----------------------------------------
   X Category  Predicted Y Category
0           1                     3
1           2                     2
2           3                     1
3           4                     2
4           5                     3
```
