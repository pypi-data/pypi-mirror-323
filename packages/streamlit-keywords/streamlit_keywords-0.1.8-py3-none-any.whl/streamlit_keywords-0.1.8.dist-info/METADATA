           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/tahouse/streamlit-keywords)

A Streamlit custom component that provides enhanced functionality over the standard `streamlit.multiselect`. Users can enter free-form text which will appear as separate keyword chips.

**Author:** Tyler House ([@tahouse](https://github.com/tahouse))

## Features

- 🏷️ **Keyword Entry**: Input multiple keywords as chips/tags.
- 📝 **Free-Form Text**: Users can enter free-form text, which will be tokenized into individual keywords.
- 🎨 **Customizable**: Customize the label, placeholder text, and set a maximum number of keywords.
- 🔢 **Keyword Limit**: Optionally limit the maximum number of keywords.
- 🎨 **Theme Integration**: Automatic integration with Streamlit's theming (dark/light modes).
- 🖥️ **Seamless Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with Streamlit apps.
- 🗑️ **Keyword Removal**: Easily remove keywords by clicking the remove icon.

## Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit-keywords
```

## Usage

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_keywords import keywords_input

# Create a keyword input
keywords = keywords_input(
    value=["example", "keywords"],
    label="Enter Keywords",
    text="Type a keyword and press Enter",
    max_keywords=5,
    key="unique_keywords_input"
)

# Display the entered keywords
st.write("Entered keywords:", keywords)
```

## Examples

Here are some usage patterns to help you integrate `streamlit_keywords` into your Streamlit app. See `example.py` for more usage examples.

### Basic Keyword Input

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_keywords import keywords_input

st.title("Keyword Input Example")

keywords = keywords_input(
    label="Keywords",
    text="Add keywords and press Enter",
    key="basic_keyword_input"
)

st.write("You have entered:", keywords)
```

### Keyword Input with Maximum Limit

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_keywords import keywords_input

keywords = keywords_input(
    label="Enter up to 5 keywords",
    max_keywords=5,
    key="keyword_input_max5"
)

st.write("Keywords:", keywords)

if keywords and len(keywords) >= 5:
    st.warning("You have reached the maximum number of keywords.")
```

### Keyword Input with Default Values

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_keywords import keywords_input

initial_keywords = ["Streamlit", "Python", "Data Science"]

keywords = keywords_input(
    value=initial_keywords,
    label="Edit your keywords",
    key="keyword_input_with_defaults"
)

st.write("Current keywords:", keywords)
```

## Component API

### `keywords_input()`

Display a Streamlit component for entering keywords.

**Signature:**

```python
def keywords_input(
    value: list = [],
    label: str = "Keywords Input",
    text: str = "Type a keyword and press Enter",
    max_keywords: Optional[int] = None,
    key: Optional[str] = None,
) -> List[str]:
```

**Parameters:**

- **`value`** *(List\[str\], optional)*:  
  Initial list of keywords. Defaults to `[]`.

- **`label`** *(str, optional)*:  
  Label for the input component. Defaults to `"Keywords Input"`.

- **`text`** *(str, optional)*:  
  Instructions or placeholder text displayed in the input field. Defaults to `"Type a keyword and press Enter"`.

- **`max_keywords`** *(Optional\[int\], optional)*:  
  Maximum number of keywords allowed. If `None`, there is no limit. Defaults to `None`.

- **`key`** *(str, optional)*:  
  An optional string to use as the unique key for the widget. It's recommended to assign a unique key to prevent the component from remounting on script reruns. Defaults to `None`.

**Returns:**

- **`List[str]`**:  
  A list of entered keywords.

## Development

This repository uses the Streamlit Component template system. If you want to modify or develop the component, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or newer.
- **Node.js and npm**: Required for frontend development.

### Backend Development

#### Install Python Dependencies

Clone the repository and install the development dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tahouse/streamlit-keywords.git
cd streamlit-keywords

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -e ".[devel]"
```

### Frontend Development

The frontend of this component is built using React and TypeScript, leveraging Material-UI components.

#### Install Node Dependencies

Navigate to the `streamlit_keywords/frontend` directory and install the dependencies as specified in `package.json`.

```bash
cd streamlit_keywords/frontend
npm install
```

**`package.json` dependencies:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@emotion/react": "^11.13.3",
    "@emotion/styled": "^11.13.0",
    "@mui/icons-material": "^6.1.6",
    "@mui/material": "^6.1.6",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "streamlit-component-lib": "^2.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object": "^7.21.11",
    "@types/node": "^22.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^17.0.2",
    "@types/react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "node": "^22.0.0",
    "react-scripts": "^5.0.1",
    "typescript": "^4.2.0"
  }
}
```

#### Running in Development Mode

To run the component in development mode with live reloading:

1. **Start the frontend development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server.

2. **Set the `_RELEASE` flag:**

   Ensure that `_RELEASE = False` is set in your `__init__.py`. This tells the component to use the local development server.

3. **Run your Streamlit app:**

   In a separate terminal, navigate back to the root directory and run your Streamlit app.

   ```bash
   cd ../../
   streamlit run your_app.py
   ```

### Building for Production

When you're ready to build the component for production:

1. **Build the frontend:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will generate the production-ready frontend assets.

2. **Update `_RELEASE` flag:**

   Set `_RELEASE = True` in `__init__.py`.

   ```python
   _RELEASE = True
   ```

3. **Your component is now ready:**

   The component is now ready for use in production environments.

## Acknowledgemnts

This project draws inspiration from multiple sources:

- **Streamlit Multiselect**: The standard Streamlit library's multiselect component served as initial inspiration, though this project extends functionality to allow free text entry.

- **streamlit-tags**: Special thanks to Gagan Bhatia (@gagan3012) for [streamlit-tags](https://github.com/gagan3012/streamlit-tags), which was what I initially used in my application. This project addresses mobile usability limitations in streamlit-tags where the enter button functioned only as a tab key.

- **Material UI**: This component is built using [Material UI](https://mui.com/)'s Autocomplete component, which provided the foundation for the user interface.

The decision to build streamlit-keywords came from a need for a modern, mobile-friendly keyword input component with up-to-date dependencies, improved mobile user experience, and theming that closely matches Streamlit's native multiselect component.
