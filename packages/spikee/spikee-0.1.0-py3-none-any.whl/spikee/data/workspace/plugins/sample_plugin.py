sample_plugin.py

This file shows a simple example plugin for spikee.
Plugins must define a `transform(text: str) -> str` function,
which takes the original text and returns a modified version.

Usage within spikee:
    spikee generate --plugins sample_plugin

Then spikee will call `transform(text)` for each prompt,
replacing it with the plugin-transformed text.
"""

def transform(text: str) -> str:
    """
    A minimal plugin that just converts the text to uppercase.
    Customize this function to implement any transformation or obfuscation 
    youâ€™d like to test against your target LLM or guardrail.

    """
    return text.upper()
