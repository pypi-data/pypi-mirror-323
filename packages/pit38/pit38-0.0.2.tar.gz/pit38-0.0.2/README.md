# PIT-38

**PIT-38** is a command-line tool that assists you in preparing the Polish [PIT-38](https://www.pit.pl/pit-38/)
declaration for investment income. It transforms raw broker reports into tax-ready documents by handling
complex calculations, currency conversions, and FIFO trade matching - all while adhering to Polish tax regulations.

## Example Use Case
*Marta, a Polish investor, made 200+ stock trades in 2024 through Freedom24, including US and EU stocks. To file her PIT-38, she needs to:*
1. Match each sale to its original purchase
2. Convert all foreign amounts to PLN using NBP rates from transaction dates
3. Calculate total income/costs for tax declaration
4. Generate PIT-8C annex

*With pit38, she simply runs:*
```bash
pit38 freedom24 annual_report_2024.xlsx
```

The tool automatically:
- Processes all trades from the XLSX report
- Matches sales with purchases using FIFO
- Applies correct NBP exchange rates (even for weekend trades)
- Generates ready-to-submit [PIT-8C](https://www.pit.pl/pit-8c/) (.pdf file)
- Creates audit-ready XLSX with all calculations

No more spreadsheet errors or manual rate lookups. ðŸš€

## Usage

### Processing an Annual Report

To process your annual tax report (.xlsx file with all the trades made during the year), use:

```bash
pit38 <broker> <tax_report_file>
```

- **broker**: the brokerâ€™s name (lowercase).
- **tax_report_file**: the XLSX file with all your trades downloaded from the supported broker.

The tool will:

1. Read the brokerâ€™s XLSX file.
2. Convert all trades (buy and sell) into an internal unified structure based on ISIN and currency.
3. Apply FIFO matching to determine partial closures.
4. Compute income and costs for each matched position.
5. Generate PIT-8C PDF report and save it near the input file.
6. Print D section of PIT-8C report to console.
7. Write the closed positions near the input file (for audit).

**Example**:

```bash
pit38 freedom24 annual_report_2024.xlsx
```

## Testing
