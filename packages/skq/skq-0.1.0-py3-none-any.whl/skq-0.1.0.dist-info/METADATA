# skq

Scientific Toolkit for Quantum Computing

This library is used in the [q4p (Quantum Computing for Programmers)](https://github.com/CarloLepelaars/q4p) course.

NOTE: This library is developed for educational purposes. While we strive for correctness of everything, the code is provided as is and not guaranteed to be bug-free. For sensitive applications make to check computations. 

## Why SKQ?

- Exploration: Play with fundamental quantum building blocks (NumPy).
- Education: Learn quantum computing concepts and algorithms.
- Integration: Combine classical components with quantum components.
- Democratize quantum for Python programmers and data scientists: Develop quantum algorithms in your favorite environment and easily export to your favorite quantum computing platform for running on real quantum hardware.

## Install

```bash
pip install skq
```
