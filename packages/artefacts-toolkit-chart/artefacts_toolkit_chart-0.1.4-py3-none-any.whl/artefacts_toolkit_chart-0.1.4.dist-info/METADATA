# Artefacts Toolkit (Charts)

A part of the Artefacts Toolkit, this package contains helpers to be used when creating charts from test data

Primarily designed to be used with Artefacts, the package can also be used standalone.

## Prerequisites

* At present, charts can only be created from rosbags. You can use the artefacts bag_recorder helper available in the toolkit to assist you in doing this in your test launch file.

```
from artefacts_toolkit_rosbag.rosbag import get_bag_recorder
```

* When using in a virtual environment, you may need to add your site packages to `PYTHONPATH`

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<your_workspace>/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```
## Usage
```
from artefacts_toolkit_chart import make_chart
```
