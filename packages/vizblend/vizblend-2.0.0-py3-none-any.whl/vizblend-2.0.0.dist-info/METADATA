VizBlend is a Python package that simplifies creating interactive analytical reports by consolidating Plotly figures into a single HTML file. It’s designed to function like a modern PowerPoint presentation but with the power of stunning and interactive data visualizations.

Whether you’re a data analyst, scientist, or developer, VizBlend streamlines the visualization workflow and enhances collaboration.

# Installation and use case

Install vizBlend using pip:
```
pip install vizBlend
```
Import VizBlend and add figures
```
from vizblend import CreateReport  
import plotly.graph_objects as go  

report = CreateReport(report_title="Sales Report")  
bar_fig = go.Figure(go.Bar(x=["A", "B", "C"], y=[10, 20, 30]))  
report.add_figure(bar_fig, {"title": "Sales Data"})
```
Generate the report
```
report_file = report.blend_graphs_to_html()  
print(f"Report saved to {report_file}")
```

# Learning Purpose

Beside its main job, this repo intends to teach aspiring data analysts or even data scientists who cannot have full control over their coding cycle. With a simple mission: create visualizations and append them to an HTML file, you can take your learning curve up to include useful skills:
* Write unit and integration tests with edge cases to ensure your code is not error-prone.

* Write CI/CD workflows to run on every push or pull request to ensure the newly committed code is compatible enough.

* Creating, managing and deploying your package to PyPi so that you can simply run `pip install <package_name>` and start using it.
