# Sum up particles and group by time step

bins:
  # For performance reasons, time should usually be the first binning variable.
  time:
    min: 2000-01-02 00:00
    max: 2000-01-05
    step: 1 days

  # Occasionally, there might be more than one time variable.
  # In the example below, we specify only the resolution, and let the
  # program figure out min/max by pre-scanning the dataset.
  start_time: 480 hours

  # The second grouping variable is "Z", with a resolution of 2.
  Z: 2
