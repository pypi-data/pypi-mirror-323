# Add projection information to output file

# In this example, we also demonstrate how derived variables can be used as
# binning variables. With the variables below, we define a grid that is rotated
# 45 degrees compared to the original grid.
derived:
  xi: X + Y
  eta: X - Y

# The bins are specified using the derived variables
bins:
  eta: [-3, -1, 1, 3]
  xi: [0, 4, 8]

# When there is a defined projection, there is also a derived
# variable AREA which denotes the area of the cell in square meters
# TODO: Currently AREA is a dummy variable which is 1 everywhere
weights: AREA

# Input file in netCDF format (ladim output format)
infile: ladim.nc

# Add projection information
projection:
  # Specify projection as a proj4 string
  proj4: +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
  # Specify variable names for the coordinates
  # Right hand side: Name of the coordinate in the Ladim file
  # Left hand side: Either x (first coordinate of projection) or y (second
  # coordinate of projection).
  x: xi
  y: eta

# Output file in netCDF format
outfile: count.nc
