# Basic example summing up particles in a two-dimensional grid

# The keyword "bins" determines the grouping variables. By convention, the
# coordinate order Y, X is most common. With the configuration below, we get
# bin edges of Y: [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20] and X: [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5].
bins:
  # The first grouping variable is "Y", with a resolution of 2.
  Y: {min: 10, max: 20, step: 2}
  # The second grouping variable is "X". In this example, we specify the bin
  # edges explicitly.
  X: [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5]
