```bash
 python manage.py migrate
```

## Using it

```python
import papertrail

###########################################################################
### Creating Entries.
###########################################################################

# Basic Usage. Timestamp defaults to now.
papertrail.log("cache-flushed", "Cache was flushed!")

# Optional Data.
papertrail.log(
    "periodic-cleanup-ran",
    "Periodic cleanup task executed.",
    data={
        "success":          True,
        "cleaned_objects":  100,
    })

# Optional Targets.
papertrail.log(
    "user-logged-in",
    f"{request.user.get_full_name()} logged in",
    targets={
        "user": request.user,
    })

# Optional Timestamp.
papertrail.log(
    "user-joined",
    "User joined site",
    targets={
        "user": request.user,
    },
    timestamp=request.user.date_joined)

# Multiple Targets.
user1 = User.objects.get(...)
user2 = User.objects.get(...)

papertrail.log(
    "user-followed",
    "User followed another user",
    targets={
        "follower":     user1,
        "following":    user2,
    })

### Querying the Papertrail.
###########################################################################

# Getting all `Papertrail` Entries, that point to `user1`, without taking
# into Account the Target Relationship Name.
qs = papertrail.related_to(user1)
entry = qs.first()

print(f"[{entry.timestamp}] {entry.type} ({entry.message}) - {entry.data}")

# Get all Entries, that point to both Users.
# Will only return Entries, that have both `user1` and `user2` in their Targets.
qs = papertrail.related_to(user1, user2)

# Query specific Relationships, such as `user1` following `user2`.
qs = papertrail.related_to(follower=user1, following=user2)

# Filtering Entries by a specific Type (or any Django ORM Filter).
qs = papertrail.filter(type="user-followed")

# And chaining.
qs = papertrail.filter(type="user-followed").related_to(follower=user1)

# Get all the Users, that have followed a specific User (`user1`).
# This might look a bit confusing at first, but can be very useful.
# The Objects, represented Filter, allow filtering a given `queryset` to contain
# only Elements, that have a specific `papertrail` Entry, pointing at them.
all_users = get_user_model().objects.all()

users_who_followed_user1 = papertrail
.filter(type="user-followed")  # Narrow down to only `user-followed` Entries,
                               # that followed `user1`
.related_to(following=user1)
.objects_represented(all_users, "followed")  # Return a User `queryset`, that
                                             # only has the Users, for which
                                             # we have a `user-followed` Entry,
                                             # that has a followed Target,
                                             # pointing at them.

# `objects_not_represented` does the same, but returns a `queryset`, that
# excludes any Object, that has a `papertrail` Entry, pointing at it.
# Get all Users, who never logged in:
users_who_never_logged_in = papertrail
.filter(type="user-logged-in")
.objects_not_represented(all_users, "user")
```

## Admin Integration

`django-papertrail` provides a Django Admin Integration to both View Entries (simple Django Admin Entry List, usually available under `/admin/papertrail/entry/`), as well as a more advanced Integration for Objects you want to keep the Track of.

The advanced Integration provides two useful Functionalities:

1) Change tracking - whenever an Object, for which the Integration is enabled, is added/edited/deleted, a `papertrail` Entry will be created.
2) A convenient Link to view all `papertrail` Entries, pointing to the Object being viewed, as well as an integrated `papertrail` Viewer:

To enable the Integration, your `ModelAdmin` Class needs to inherit from `AdminEventLoggerMixin`:

```python
from papertrail.admin import AdminEventLoggerMixin


class MyObjectAdmin(AdminEventLoggerMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass


# The admin papertrail viewer can have filters:
papertrail_type_filters = {
    "Login events": (
        "user-logged-in",
        "user-logged-out"),
    "Social events": (
        "user-followed",
        "user-unfollowed"),
}
```

A Viewer with Filters would look like this:
