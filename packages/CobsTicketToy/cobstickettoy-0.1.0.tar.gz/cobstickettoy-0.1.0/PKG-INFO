# CobsTicketToy
First project of my toy project
It's about Ticket reservation
## Main Feature
- Activate link button or open Ticket reservation page on time automatically.

■ ProtoCobsToy
- Just one step ahead of others

■ Purpose 
- It’s so hard to get tickets. I really want one!

■ Expected Effects
- "By staying one step ahead of others, you might be able to get the spot you want, right?"

■ Rationale
- "Sometimes, the sales page or link button opens even before the scheduled sale time."

■ Target
- "A person who always fails to secure a ticket and refuses to pay a premium for it."
