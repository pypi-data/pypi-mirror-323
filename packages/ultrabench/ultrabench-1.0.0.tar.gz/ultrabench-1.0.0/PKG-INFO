# UltraBench

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2501.13193-b31b1b.svg)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13193)

UltraBench is a standardized benchmark of 14 different convex ultrasound image classification and semantic segmentation tasks (7 classification and 7 segmentation tasks) drawn from the 10 different publicly available datasets covering 11 regions of the body. This repository contains the processing scripts to transform raw datasets from their original sources into a standardized format for training and evaluating machine learning models.

This benchmark was published alongside the article [Revisiting Data Augmentation for Ultrasound Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13193). If you use this benchmark in your research please cite this article and the articles for each of the included datasets. Instructions for how to do so are provided at the end.

## Motivation

A common limitation of studies on ultrasound image analysis using machine learning is a lack of evaluations across multiple domains. However, this is made difficult by a lack of ultrasound image analysis tasks in existing medical image analysis benchmarks, such as [MedMNIST](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01721-8), [MedSegBench](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04159-2) and the [Medical Segmentation Decathlon](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30695-9). To address this issue, we created UltraBench. Our aim is to make it easier for researchers by standardizing the preprocessing of many publicly available ultrasound datasets and providing tools (e.g., dataset implementations for common deep learning frameworks) that (a) reduce the effort required to use them and (b) make it easier for researchers to compare results between papers.

## Installation

Install UltraBench using:

```bash
pip install ultrabench
```

## Getting Started

UltraBench is packaged as a commandline application. After installing, run
`ultrabench --help` to get started.
