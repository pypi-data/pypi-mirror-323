class Dispatcher:
    """A highlevel interface for the dispatch API.

    This class provides a highlevel interface to the dispatch API.
    It provides two channels:

    Lifecycle events:
        A channel that sends a dispatch event message whenever a dispatch
        is created, updated or deleted.

    Running status change:
        Sends a dispatch message whenever a dispatch is ready
        to be executed according to the schedule or the running status of the
        dispatch changed in a way that could potentially require the consumer to start,
        stop or reconfigure itself.

    Example: Processing running state change dispatches
        ```python
        import os
        from frequenz.dispatch import Dispatcher
        from unittest.mock import MagicMock

            async for dispatch in changed_running_status:

                    print(f"Executing dispatch {dispatch.id}, due on {dispatch.start_time}")

                            run_parameters=dispatch.payload, # custom actor parameters
                            dry_run=dispatch.dry_run,
                            until=dispatch.until,
                        )  # this will reconfigure the actor
                    else:
                        # this will start a new actor with the given components
                        # and run it for the duration of the dispatch
                        actor.start(
                            components=dispatch.target,
                            run_parameters=dispatch.payload, # custom actor parameters
                            dry_run=dispatch.dry_run,

                else:
                    actor.stop()  # this will stop the actor
        ```

    Example: Getting notification about dispatch lifecycle events
        ```python

            microgrid_id = 1

            dispatcher = Dispatcher(

            )

            async for event in events_receiver:

                        assert_never(unhandled)
        ```

    Example: Creating a new dispatch and then modifying it.
        Note that this uses the lower-level `Client` class to create and update the dispatch.

        This receiver will receive a message whenever the current running

        Usually, one message per scheduled run is to be expected.
        However, things get complicated when a dispatch was modified:

        If it was currently running and the modification now says
        it should not be running or running with different parameters,
        then a message will be sent.

        In other words: Any change that is expected to make an actor start, stop
        or reconfigure itself with new parameters causes a message to be
        sent.

        A non-exhaustive list of possible changes that will cause a message to be sent:
         - The normal scheduled start_time has been reached
         - The duration of the dispatch has been modified
         - The start_time has been modified to be in the future

         - The active status changed
         - The dry_run status changed
         - The payload changed
         - The dispatch was deleted
