# Teams in LLMling

## Overview

Teams in LLMling allow you to organize and orchestrate multiple agents as a group. Teams provide:
- Parallel and sequential execution
- Shared contexts and prompts
- Controlled agent communication
- Compatibility with agent routing patterns
- Chain execution capabilities

## Creating Teams

### Direct Creation

```python
from llmling_agent.delegation import Team

team = Team(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    shared_prompt="Team objective",
    name="analysis_team"
)
```

### Using Pool Helper

```python
# Create from agent names
team = pool.create_team(
    agents=["analyzer", "planner", "executor"],
    model_override="gpt-4",               # Override model for all agents
    environment_override="env.yml",        # Override environment
    shared_prompt="Team objective",        # Common prompt
)
```

## Team Execution Patterns

### Parallel Execution

All team members work simultaneously:

```python
# Run all agents in parallel
team_response = await team.run_parallel(prompt="Analyze this code")

# Access results
for response in team_response:
    if response.success:
        print(f"{response.agent_name}: {response.message.content}")
    else:
        print(f"{response.agent_name} failed: {response.error}")

# Get timing information
print(team_response.format_durations())
```

### Sequential Execution

Agents execute one after another:

```python
# Run agents in sequence
results = await team.run_sequential(prompt="Review this PR")

# Access ordered results
for response in results:
    print(f"Step {response.agent_name}: {response.message.content}")
```

### Chain Execution

Pass data through a chain of agents:

```python
# Each agent processes previous agent's output
final_message = await team.chain(
    initial_message,
    require_all=True  # Fail if any agent fails
)

# Or stream the chain results
async with team.chain_stream(initial_message) as stream:
    async for chunk in stream.stream():
        print(chunk)
```

## Team as a Target Container

Teams are compatible with LLMling's routing patterns:

```python
# Forward results from an agent to team
agent >> team  # All team members receive results

# Forward team results to another agent
team >> other_agent

# Create complex routing
(team1 & team2) >> coordinator  # Union of teams

# Using pass_results_to
agent.pass_results_to(
    team,
    connection_type="run",    # How to handle messages
    priority=1,              # Task priority
    delay=timedelta(seconds=1)  # Optional delay
)
```

## Team Distribution and Knowledge Sharing

Share content and capabilities across team members:

```python
await team.distribute(
    content="Shared context information",
    tools=["tool1", "tool2"],         # Tools to share
    resources=["resource1.txt"]       # Resources to share
)
```

## Team Response Handling

Teams provide rich response objects:

```python
team_response = await team.run_parallel(prompt)

# Success/failure information
successful = team_response.successful  # List of successful responses
failed = team_response.failed         # List of failed responses

# Timing information
print(f"Total duration: {team_response.duration}s")

# Get specific agent's result
planner_response = team_response.by_agent("planner")

# Convert to chat message
message = team_response.to_chat_message()
```

## Team Composition

Teams can be composed using the `&` operator:

```python
# Create combined team
analysis_team = analyzer & researcher & summarizer

# Compose existing teams
full_team = analysis_team & review_team

# Create groups inline
(analyzer & researcher) >> reviewer
```

## Routing Control

Fine-tune how messages flow through the team:

```python
# Connect with specific settings
team.pass_results_to(
    target,
    connection_type="context",  # Add as context
    priority=1,                # Higher priority
    delay=timedelta(minutes=1) # Delayed execution
)

# Get communication stats
stats = team.connections.stats
print(f"Messages handled: {stats.message_count}")
print(f"Total tokens: {stats.token_count}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Team Size**: Keep teams focused and reasonably sized
2. **Error Handling**: Use `require_all` appropriately for chains
3. **Resources**: Share common resources through `distribute()`
4. **Monitoring**: Use response objects for execution monitoring
5. **Composition**: Use team composition for complex workflows

## Common Patterns

### Analysis Pipeline

```python
# Create specialized team
analysis_team = pool.create_team(
    ["analyzer", "reviewer", "summarizer"],
)

# Connect to result handler
analysis_team >> result_collector

# Run analysis
await analysis_team.run_parallel("Analyze this code")
```

### Team Task information

```python
team_response = await team.run_parallel(prompt)

print(f"Execution time: {team_response.duration:.2f}s")
print(f"Successful: {len(team_response.successful)}")
print(f"Failed: {len(team_response.failed)}")

for response in team_response.failed:
    print(f"Error in {response.agent_name}: {response.error}")
```
