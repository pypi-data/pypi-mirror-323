description='PyTorchAutoForge library is based on raw PyTorch and designed to automate DNN development, model tracking and deployment, tightly integrated with MLflow and Optuna. It also supports spiking networks libraries (WIP). Model optimization and deployment can be performed using ONNx, pyTorch facilities or TensorRT (WIP). The library also aims to be compatible with Jetson Orin Nano Jetpack rev6.1.'
