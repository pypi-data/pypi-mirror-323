# HTML to Text Converter

This Python package provides functions for converting HTML files to a simple text format by extracting data from tables within the HTML. It processes all HTML files in a given directory, converts them to text, and combines them into a single file, optionally including timestamps and app names.

## Features

- **Convert HTML to Text**: Convert HTML files with tables into a plain text format, with data from each table row.
- **Batch Process HTML Files**: Process all `.html` files in a directory and output them as `.txt` files.
- **Combine Text Files**: Combine multiple `.txt` files into one, with optional date headers.
- **Clean Up**: Optionally remove the output folder after processing.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following:

```bash
pip install credex001
