## Introduction 🌟

Hyperparameter tuning is often a time-consuming task in machine learning. While techniques like grid search or random search are common, they can be computationally expensive. This repository introduces a novel approach using **genetic algorithms** to optimize **XGBoost** hyperparameters. The algorithm mimics the process of natural selection to find the best hyperparameters more efficiently.

By evolving a population of candidate solutions, this method automatically adjusts the parameters to improve the XGBoost model's accuracy, speed, and overall performance.

## Features 🚀

- **Genetic Algorithm** to optimize hyperparameters for XGBoost.
