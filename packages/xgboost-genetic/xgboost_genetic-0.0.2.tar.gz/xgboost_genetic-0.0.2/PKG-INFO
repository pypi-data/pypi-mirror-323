# XGBoost Genetic Algorithm 🧬 + 📊

This project combines the power of **XGBoost** and **Genetic Algorithms** to optimize hyperparameters for machine learning models. By using a genetic approach, we can efficiently search for the best-performing set of hyperparameters for XGBoost, improving model performance and reducing manual hyperparameter tuning time.

## Introduction 🌟

Hyperparameter tuning is often a time-consuming task in machine learning. While techniques like grid search or random search are common, they can be computationally expensive. This repository introduces a novel approach using **genetic algorithms** to optimize **XGBoost** hyperparameters. The algorithm mimics the process of natural selection to find the best hyperparameters more efficiently.

By evolving a population of candidate solutions, this method automatically adjusts the parameters to improve the XGBoost model's accuracy, speed, and overall performance.

## Features 🚀

- **Genetic Algorithm** to optimize hyperparameters for XGBoost.
- Efficient search for optimal configurations using crossover, mutation, and selection.
- Easily extensible and configurable for different datasets and tasks.
- Compatible with any dataset where XGBoost is applicable.
