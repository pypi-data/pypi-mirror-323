    "Generative AI SHAP (GenAISHAP) is a python library that supports the creation of explanations to the metrics obtained for solutions based on LLMs (Large Language Models) or SLMs (Small Language Models). \n",
    "\n",
    "When building an LLM-or-SLM based solution one of the first challenges is how to measure the quality of the responses from the \"Agent\". Here, libraries like  [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) or [promptflow](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow) help on the evaluation of the quality of the solution by using metrics like **faithfulness**, **groundedness**, **context precision**, **context recall**, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open challenge is to add explainability to those quality metrics.  To answer questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Why a particular question is marked with a higher/lower metric (e.g., faithfulness)?*\n",
    "- *What are the common characteristics of the user questions that produce good or bad **faithfulness**?*\n",
    "- *What type of prompts produce better or lower **context recall**?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer of those questions helps on the debugging of the overall solution and gives more insights to where to focus the next steps to improve the metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows an example of how to create the **Input** for GenAISHAP, which is a simple Pandas DataFrame with the evaluation dataset. This dataset should have at least the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User input, question or prompt. Column name should be `user_input` and its type should be string.\n",
    "- One column for each metric already calculated, for example **faithfulness**, **context precision**, **context recall**.  All numerical columns will be assumed to be a metric column.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook a pandas Dataframe like the following will be produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/input_example.png\" width=\"1200\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this example, the column `user_input` will be used to refer to the user prompt, and the columns `faithfulness`, `context_precision` and `context_recall` will be used as metric columns since those columns are numerical.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The other columns, `retrieved_contexts`, `response`, and `reference` are not needed for **GenAISHAP** but are normally required for the calculation of the metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Import relevant libraries and load environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that before you run this notebook you have a `.env` file with the following variables with their respective values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OPENAI_API_VERSION\n",
    "- AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\n",
    "- OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
    "- PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8\n",
    "- PYTHONUTF8=1\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that here we are not importing **genaishap** library, since this notebooks is only an example of how to create the input for the GenAISHAP execution.\n"
