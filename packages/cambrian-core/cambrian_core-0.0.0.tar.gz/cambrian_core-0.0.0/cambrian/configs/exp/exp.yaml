defaults:
  # NOTE: there is a bug in OmegaConf that doesn't allow optional dataclass objects
  # that are inherited to be specified via the defaults list. For instance,
  # if you have the following structured configs:
  #
  # @dataclass
  # class A:
  #   a: Optional[int] = None
  #
  # @dataclass
  # class B(A):
  #   pass
  #
  # And you define B in a config file where you specify it's config group such that
  # OmegaConf thinks it's a structured config, a will always be None unless you
  # explicitly set it in B. Like if you set a default value to it in A, that won't carry
  # over to B. This is the case for renderer since it's Optional. Therefore, we define
  # it here rather than the env config.
  - /env/renderer: bev

  # Optional config groups for experiments
  # Defining here means we don't need to have a + when overriding from the command line
