medical officer, examined all four

The men were taken to the Jock-

blue Chinese uniforms they were

The other three are Lt. Lyle W.

Cameron saw a banjo on a shelf
at the Jockey Club and yelled:

“What shal] we sing, boys?’’

One of the fliers, already in the

‘Cross over the Bridge.’ ’”’

Cameron strummed the banjo
and they all hummed, but nobody
could remember any words but
“Cross over the Bridge.’’ So they
all burst out with that about every
15 seconds and then went back to
humming

Heller was handed a letter from

 slacks, the men were taken to Kai-

"LONDON ®# — Lord Beaver-
brook’s Evening Standard today
challenged the Archbishop of
Canterbury's statement that
the Church of England brought
no pressure on Princess Mar-
garet.

The editorial kept alive a
controversy surrounding the
church as a result of Margar-
et’s termination of her romance
with Peter Townsend. Stirred
up also were ashes of dispute
that surrounded the abdication
of King Edward VIII in 1936.

The Archbishop, Dr. Geof-
frey Fisher, is the ranking pre-
late of the Church of England.
He said last night Margaret re-
nounced plans to marry Town-
send without pressure from the
church — although, he added,
she “got plenty of advice—ask-
ed for, and a good deal unasked
for.”

The Archbishop also denied
that his predecessor, Dr. Cos-
mo Lang, had taken any part
in the crisis when Edward ab-
dicated to marry Wallis War-
field Simpson.

Dr. Lang's biographer, J. G.
Lockhart, and the Duke of
Windsor himself have pictur-
ed Lang as one of the impor-
tant characters in that drama.
The Evening Standard said:

“Dr. Fisher’s memory on this
point is faulty. So is his version
of recent events.

“For the Archbishop now
makes the curious statement
that ‘there was no pressure
from the church’ on Princess
Margaret.

“Yet, quite apart from a num-
ber of minor prelates and
church dignitaries who gave
their views on the matter, the
Archbishop himself, on two oc-
casions when Princess Margar-
et was known to be making up
her mind, gave his own version
of the church’s view on di-
vorce.”

"CHICAGO (f\ — The American

United Press Staff Correspondent

Washington, May 17.—The Pub-
lic Health Service said today it
will take until mid-July or August
to finish the free polio inocula-
tion program for the nation’s 9
million first and second graders.

Only then will the government’s
new voluntary. distribution plan go
into effect. And only then will
more than 7 million other children
from five through nine begin get-
ting their Salk shots,

The data presents a sharp and
discouraging setback in the vac-
cination timetable. But health ser-
vice officials still expressed con-
 fidence most five - through - nine
‘youngsters will receiye their two
‘shots before the polio season hits
its peak in various areas in Aug-
ust and September.

_ Dr. Leonard A. Scheele, U.S.
surgeon general, said today this
estimate could be thrown out of
‘kilter if there should be a medi-
leal decision to halt shots briefiy
during the season peak because of
‘the possibility of triggering the on-
‘set of polio w shere it already is in-
cubating.

Wait And See

| But he said there is no present
‘recommendation to do this and
that the problem won’t be consid-
ered until experts see what hap-
pens as the season peak nears
some weeks hence.

It may well turn out, he said,
that the experts will decide that
protecting thousands against polio
will outweigh whatever danger
there may be in the little-under-
stood phenomenon of polio some-
times being induced by any kind
of injections during the height of
the polio season.

Congressmen were disappointed
at the slowness of the inoculations,
but they voiced general approval
of the voluntary distribution plan
announced Monday by President
Eisenhower.

House committees promised quick
