"LONDON, Jan. 25.—\P—Prime
Minister Winston Churchill today
rejected a suggestion in the House
of Commons that he meet with So-
viet Premier Georgi Malenkov in
an attempt to ease the tense situa-
tion in the Far East.

“I don’t conceive that a meeting
on the Far East between me and
Mr. Malenkov would be likely to
yield favorable results at the pres-
ent time,” the prime minister said.

The issue of a Churchill-Malen-
kov meeting was raised by labor-
ite members alarmed by the rapid
pace of threatening developments
in the Formosa area.

Reliable British diplomatic
sources have indicated, however,
that direct feelers looking toward
a cease-fire in the war in the For-
-mosan Straits may be under-
taken in Peiping.

The Foreign Office said ‘‘con-
-sultations are continuing” on ways
. obtaining a Formosan cease-

ire.

ion Egypt to pull her troops out of
jthe Bl Auja demilitarized zone, It
‘also urged the setiing up of a

;Hammarskjold’s peace plan would
reestablish order in the area, the
cene of what has been described
/as the most serious fighting since
‘the 1948 Palestine War.

troubled holy land.

Expresses Concern

The secretary general expressed
grave concern to Israel over the
attack in the demilitarized zone
Wednesday night.

Meanwhile, the Western Big
Three waited for clearer reports
on the situation as they pondered
whether to bring the issue before
ithe U.N. Security Council. Observ-

would await the reaction of Israel

and Egypt to Hammarskjold's plan
before making. any move to con-

The three nations declared in
1960 that if they found any Middle
Bast country was preparing to vi-
olate frontiers, they would “im.
mediately take action, both within
and outside the U. N.”

"FORMOSA, Argentina (UP)—Re-
ports from nearby Paraguay today
said rebels supported by troops
and police are battling forces loyal
to President Alfredo Stroessner,
who seized power 19 months ago.

Telephone services with Asun-
cion, the Paraguayan capital, has
been interrupted since Tuesday
night, when the revolt began, and
no information about the progress
of the uprising could be obtained
immediately.

| Unconfirmed reports said the re-
| volt was led by Epifanio Mendez

Fleitas, president of Paraguay’s
central bank, and supported by the
garrison at Campo Grande, a big
army base near Asuncion.

_ Public Works Minister Marcial
Sananiego, a major general who
also commanded the Campo
Grande garrison, is said to be sup-
porting the revolt.

Reports of fierce fighting in the
streets of Asuncion were denied by
the newspaper El Dia, of Posadas,
Argentina, which said police as
well as troops are supporting the

uprising.

The revolt is said to have started
when Stroessner ordered the arrest
of Mendez, who was closely asso-
ciated with the Argentine regime
of ousted ex-President Juan D.
Peron, on charges of plotting
against the government.

Recurrent unrest in Paraguay
has been intensified recently by
that country’s agreement to re-
ceive Peron when he fled into exile
from Buenos Aires. As long ago
as October, troops were patrolling
the streete of Asuncion.

"| WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Agriculture Department predict-
ed Tuesday that this year’s crop
of winter wheat will be one-
fourth smaller than average.
This reflected the effects of a
federal crop control program
and drought conditions in some
Great Plains producing areas.

The crop was indicated at 653
million bushels, compared with
662 million forecast a month
,ago. Production was 791 million
last year and 867 million for
the 10-year average.

No forecast will be made on
the spring wheat crop until June
10, but a production of about 177
million bushels is possible, the
department has said, on the bas-
is of the prospectwe acreage.
Thus, a total wheat crop of about
830 million bushels was indicat-
ed, compared with 970 million
produced last year and 1,110,000,-
000 for the 10-year average.

SUCH A CROP would fall
short of anticipated market
needs of around 900 million
bushels. However, about one bil-
lion bushels in reserve and sur-
plus supplies from past crops
are in storage—largely under
government price support pro-
grams—and available for’ the
market. |

In a May crop report, limited

largely to wheat, the depart-
ment said the current farm pro-
duction picture is dominated by
excellent growing conditions in
the main livestock feed = grain
areas. It said good soil moisture
conditions exist in north central
and northeastern areas.
The outlook was said to remain
discouraging in parts of the
southern Great Plains, where
chronic drought persists.

The department said progress
of farm field work during April
was rapid where soils were dry
for any considerable period.

"CHICAGO—The American Med-
ical Assn. has asked its members
to cooperate in a voluntary gov-
ernment priority plan for polio in-
oculations ofchildren 5 through

9.

In a statement released yester-
day through Chicago headquarters,
Dr. Walter B. Martin of Norfolk,
 Va., president ‘of the AMA, said.

“The AMA has \been ‘assured
that technical problems relating to
‘the safe manufacture of polio vac-
cine have been worked out and the
vaccination program will move a-
head.

“In behalf of myself and the
AMA Board of Trustees I have as-
sured President Eisenhower that
the nation’s ‘physicians will coop-
erate in limiting polio vaccination
to children from 5 through 9 until
the vaccine is available in larger
supply.”

Dr. Martin said that children in
this age group who do not receive
the vaccine during the current pro-
gram of the National: Foundation
for Infantile Paralysis for first and
second-graders will be vaccinated
after its completion.

The AMA, Dr. Martin added. “is
asking all phys icians to administer
vaccine only to children in the pri-
ority age group until further no-
tice. This will assure that the vac-
cine will be used first for those
most susceptibe to the disease.”

He said the voluntary program
follows the recommendation of the
National Advisory Committee on
Poliomyelitis Vaccination approv-
edby Secretary Oveta Culp Hobby.

He said the physicians will keep
a record of each child vaccinated,
including the name, age and date
of vaccination, the manufacturer
of the vaccine and the lot number.

several hundred thousand dollars.
The Weather Bureau said _ the
storm was “‘one of the worst’ in
Billings’ history.

Thousands of windows in the
business and residential districts
were shattered by the storm short-
ly after 2 p.m. Flower beds, gar-
dens and crops were beaten into
the ground, roofs and siding on
structures were punctured and
autos and airplanes badly dam-
aged by the wind driven hail-
stones.

The storm brought a total of.88
 of an inch precipitation in a 28 min-
ute period.

The Weather Bureau said stones
measured up to 2'% inches. But
pellets three inches in diameter
were reported picked up in the
Lockwood com,aunity.

The storm was driven by wind
gusts up to 54 miles pe: hour.

The hail punctured roofs and
cracked siding on homes, dented
steel tops, chipped paint and broke
windows on hundreds of autos.

Electric power and telephone
service was disrupted.
| A district court trial was re-
-cessed when hail smashed through
the courtroom windows. The coun-
ty hospital was put at the head of
the priority list for repair work.
| Authorities said it was “hit hard.”

T. E. Duke, city building inspec-
tor, said the main fury of the
storm apparently hit the northwest
‘residential section. He estimated
‘at least a third of the cement
‘roof tiles on a new English Lu-
theran Church were broken in the
storm.

Joe Hopper, a greenhouse own-
_ er, said the hail pounded through

Snow flurries were reported in

Holland got a nice shower start.
ing about 11 this morning, but 1
didn’t do much in the way of shov.
ing down the mercury.

For a few minutes the water
came down hard, but it soon settled
down to a light sprinkle.

What the rain did do, however
was to furnish some hope that the
week-long heat wave that has
blistered the entire nation was due
to break up.

Even the Weather Bureau was
sighting some possible relief, but
not before Saturday.

Forecast for tonight was warm
and humid with a chance of scat-
tered thunder showers Friday
afternoon. And even with this, the
experts predicted the temperature
would get up to 93 Friday.

This morning just before the rain
it was 87 degrees in Holland while
Holland State Park recorded 84.
Water temperature was still a
warm 70.

Although there’s no doubt that it
is hot, Holland residents should
feel fairly secure if they take a
look at Detroit.

There they've really got a prob-
lem--severe water shortage.

“‘God help us if we have another
day like Wednesday,’ one city
official said.

And there was a lot of water
pumped in Detroit Wednesday—
722,850,000 gallons, far exceeding
the old record set last July 27.
It was the first time the city had
ever pumped more than 700 million
gallons.

Despite the record water con-
sumption, however, new restric-
tions on water use that were put
in effect last week apparently con-
served enough to keep faucets
from running dry in some of the
harder-hit sections.

Around the nation the heat was
both humorous and serious.

In Chicago, a merciful employer
issued an order that his employes
could wear shorts to work. Irving
Rosman set the pace by showing
up in a natty pair of Bermuda
shorts, About 80 of his 400 em-
ployes followed suit, including
pretty secretaries who sported
white tennis shorts and high heeled
shoes.

But Judge Irwin J. Hasten of
Chicago's Women’s Court ruled the
heat was no excuse for scanty
attire. Women were forbidden to
appear before him in anything
briefer than a skirt.

On the serious side, James
Brown was injured when a keg
of ice slid on him from a re-
frigerated freight car in New
York. Another Gotham resident,
trying to escape the heat by sleep-
ing on the roof of a Bowery hotel,
was seriously injured when he
rolled off and fell 17 floors to the
street.

Besides dragging out the record
“White Christmas’ and playing
it six months early, those who are
suffering from the heat might take
a look at the weather reports from
some other places around the
world.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, had its
first snowfall in 37 years and Men-
doza, Argentina, shivered through
its lowest temperatures in 22 years
—6 degrees bélow zero,

It was precisely the same tem-
perature in Hell and Paradise,
cities in Norway that had equal
readings of 59 degrees,

And a “heat wave’ gripped the
North Pole. The temperature was
near zero, but the sun was so
hot that Soviet scientists in the
region went sun-bathing on the ice

"WASHINGTON ~—UP— A new
baltle opened in Congress Wednes-
‘lay over Sen. Jolin W. Bricker’s

proposed constilutianal amendment

iederal government.

The Ohio Republican argued for
nis proposal as the first witness ‘be-
fore a Senate Judiciary subcommit-
tee. He ‘said. in a prepared statc-
ment that he had revised the
amendment he first offered in the
jast Congress but. had not changed
his objectives.

The Sesate a year /ago rejected
the Bricker proposa) after weelts
of debate and a narrow vote. Pres-
ident Eisenhower opposed it: then,
and Secretary of Siate Joln Fos-
ter Dulles, said Tuesday: the admin

istration opposes the 1956 version
also,

Bricker said’ his amendment
would declare thal a treaty or oth-
er Internationa; agreement whieh
conflicts with the constitution ‘shall
have. not validy nor shall.cither be:
come. clfective: as domestic law
without congressional approval.

Bricker denied. that. the amend-
ment woulkl restrict the President
in exercising foreign policy, But he
said it would keep the President
from making “one-man law"" by.

Eden asked the Queen to convene

the worst industrial dispute in Brit-

Eden took the first step prepara-
tory to the declaration of a state

service.

The full impact of the strike of
70,000 railway engineers and fire-
men, called Saturday night had
been softened by the Whitsun and
Monday bank holidays. It hit with
full fury today.

The walkout, to enforee demands
for premium pay, was certain to
produce serious industrial cutbacks
iff it continued much longer. Two
major steel companies employing
52,000 workers already have warn-
ed they might be forced to cease
production.

for a state of emergency if the
strikers refuse to return to work.

"| WASHINGTON WP) —

Sen. Richard B. Russell
‘sharply questioned today
the “propriety or the
equity” of the administra-
tion's plan to impose a com-
pulsory reserve obligation
on veterans.

Russell, chairmah of the

‘Senate Armed Services
Committee, thus took issue with
one of the main props of the ad-

program.
| The Georgia Democrat raised
his challenge to the administra-

Three Days of Hearings

The committee scheduled only
three days of hearings, with the
goal of reporting out a reserve
bill for Senate action in 10 days.
| Lead-off witnesses on the first

 

day of hearings were representa-

technical and labor groups. The
administration is scheduled — to
present its case for the reserve

"PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 3—#8—
Bad weather today forced a 24-
hour postponement of the coast-to-
coast Bendix Trophy race by six
Air Force pilots flying the nation’s
fastest jet fighters.

But despite a limited ceiling and
hazy visibility, the three-day na-
tional aircraft show opened as
scheduled before an estimated 60,-
000 persons at International Air-
port.

The 2,325-mile cross-country
flight of the supersonic jets was
delayed because Air Force officials
doubted whether the planes would
be able to land due te the low
ceiling.

The jets are due to take off to-
morrow morning from the George
Air Force Base at Victoryville,
Calif. In streaking across the coun-
try, making only one stop for
refueling, the F-100 Super Sabre
Jets are expected to average more
than 650 miles an hour, possibly
bettering the existing record of
652.522 set last March by Col.
Robert R. Scott in an F-84 Thun-
derstreak.

Tomorrow's program also fea-
tures another coast-to-coast race:
the General Electric Trophy event
in which three six-engine Boeing
B-47 Stratojet bombers, with a
three-man crew, will fly non stop
2.337 miles from March Air _
Sane in California.

The Air Force canceled its hour-,
long aerial exhibition today in the
interests of safety because cloudy
skies coupled with a misty over-
cast reduced the ceiling below the
minimum of 2,500 feet and the
visibility was less than the re-
quired five miles.

The rest of the program was.
undisturbed, The Army, Navy and
Marines in-the-air demonstrations
were confined mainly to slow-mov-
ing propeller-type craft or helicop-
ters.
