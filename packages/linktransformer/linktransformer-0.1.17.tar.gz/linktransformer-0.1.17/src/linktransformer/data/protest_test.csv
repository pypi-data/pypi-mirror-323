air traffic controllers end their
four-day strike at six of Brit-
ain’s seven major airports at
midnight tonight. They. planned
to resume a slowdown at Lon-

to French and Spanish .con-
trollers already on a slowdown
to coordinate with them.

handles much trans-Atlantic air
traffic, said they would contin-

Strike leaders said if. the
Frénch and Spanish controllers
join’ forces with’ them, they
could pose a: “powerful new
threat” to air traffic in Western
Europe. But air traffic has con-
tinued although the Spanish
controllers began their slow-
down a year ago, the French
began theirs on Friday, and the
British strikers staged a 10-day
slowdown at London’s Heat-
hrow and Gatwick airports for
10-days before they struck last
Thursday.

Leaders of the ,Frerich air

today to decide their. response

 Pet Measures Being Salvaged
as Night Sessions Are Begun
 ",,"Washington, Feb, _15.—Recogniz-
‘ing the principle that “politics is the
science of exigencies” members of
congress are doing their best to sal-

Vage pet measures from tice present
legislative tangle. The senate has
already embarked on night sessions
as a means of reducing the conges-
ticn because only a few days remain
before adjournment. There is no
secret made of the fact that many
legislators’ political careers depend
upon developments between now
and March 4. The senate and house
leaders have notified their friends
in social cireles that social engage-
ments are not interesting to them
while pclitical factors dominate at
the capitol. It is truly remarkable
how much may be aecomplished
when congress is hard-pressed for
time and fearful of consequences
back home.

Unquesticnably the most absorb-
ing topic in Washington is the atti-
tude of the president in regard to the
farm relief legislation. It is a matter
which transeends party lines and
has a direct bearing upon the 1928
presidential campaign. The com-
ment in official circles are divergent.
Scme say that the president will up-
hold his previous position and veto
the MeNary-Haugen farm relief bill;
others sax he will sign it, believing
that it will result in a court test as
to the constitutionality of the legis-
lation. Belief exists that congress
has passed the responsibility for
farm legislation to the president,
knowing full well it will influence
his plans fer renomination. Tt is
probable that the conferees on this
bill may reach a compromise, which
would lessen the political tension.

has been pending for considerable

he felt there were “30 or so
constant drug users” in the town of
1,700 residents. He added, “Kids in
Bedford are taking hog tranquiliz-

Leslie Brody, acting director of
the Iowa Drug Abuse Authority
(IDAA), believes that the estimate
of the number of users in Bedford
is probably correct. The IDAA and
two other state agencies sponsored
a comprehensive study in 1974 of
drug abuse. The study was updated
in 1976.

The studies found that some 10
per cent of Iowans over the age of
13 have used at least one of the
iNegal drugs. The use of illicit
drugs is most common among.
those aged 14 to 17

The 1976 survey reported that
 among rural males aged 14 to 17,

283 per cent had used marijuana or
hashish, 13 per cent had used LSD
or other hallucinogens, 12 per cent
had used heroin and 12 per cent had
used cocaine.

The use of illicit drugs seems to
be diffusing from urban areas into
rural Iowa, and many illicit drugs
— including illicitly manufactured
amphetamines and marijuana and
cocaine — are easily obtainable in
most parts of the state.

The 1976 survey found instances
of youngsters experimenting with
alcohol at the age of six, and using
drugs other than alcohol on a
regular basis by the age of 10.

The vast majority of Jowans do
not use illegal drugs: But the
findings of the surveys indicate
that there is a drug problem in

Not A Rare Occurance
 ","By Herman N. Bundesen, M. D
 ","By Herman N. Bundesen, M. D.

While cancer is generally
thoucht of us as a disease of adults,
particularly of the elderly, it does
take oa considerable toll) among
children.

In fact, statistics indicate it is
second only to accidents as a
cause of death among children.

On The Increase

And, unfortunately, the inci-
dence of childhood cancer appears
to be increasing. This is particu-
‘larly true as far as leukemia—
generally described as cancer of
the blood—is concerned.

There are reasons, of course,
for this increase. And we think we
know what one of the primary
reasons is.
| We believe that the decrease in
the number of deaths from the in-
fectious diseases such as pneu.
‘monia, diphtheria, — tuberculosis
and the like, means that more
children are living longer now to
contract cancer.

Same Reasoning

The same reasoning apparently
,applies to the increase in cancer
cases among the elderly during
‘the last few decades.

| Moreover, many children are
born with malignant tumors.

We also are detecting many
more cases of cancer among chil-
idren than we did heretofore.

Approximately 12 per cent of all
deaths between the ages of one
and 14 can be traced to some
form of cancer. More than half
(of the cases of leukemia begin be-
fore the age of five.
 Childhood cancer + somewhat

different from) the disease usualls
found ino oadults an that at offen
occurs a sites: seldom involved mn
jadalt cancer,
{ In children, a malignancy is
pmore likely to develop in the
_blood-forming, or hematopoietic
isystem, the central and = sympa-
‘thetic nervous system, the bone,
kidney, adrenal) clands and the
soft) tissues,

Obviously, thorough physical
checkups are just) as important
tor children as they are for adults.
1 beheve they are even more im-
portant

Investigate Promptly

Any solid mass or lump, whether
itis noticed in oa child or ino an
adult, should) be investigated at
once. Chances are it) may not be
cancerous, But it just dvesn’'t pay
to take any chances.

The earher cancer is discov:
ered. as T have said) so many
times before. the better chance it
has of being cured. Many kinds
of cancer can be cured, if we de-
tect them in time.

QUESTION AND ANSWER

Can vou tell me aif there is) any-
thing TP ocan do to change this con-
dition?

out Duane Thomas said he
would report to the Cowboys
training camp at Thousand
Oaks, Calif., Friday but
changed his mind six hours lat-
er, the Dallas Times Herald re-
ported Friday.

“T have decided not to report
today because I feel spiritual
about this.” Times Herald
sports writer Steve Perkins
quoted Thomas.

“Td rather sacrifice my ca-

have a fair shake—not only at
Dallas, but at other places in
the league,” Thomas said in a
telephone conversation from his

 Perkins said Thomas told
him in a pre-dawn telephone
conversation that he would re-

noon. In a later call, Thomas
said he had changed his mind.

“T was telling him to take his

12,700 Workers Off The Job In Dispute At Delco
 ","By TED KREITER
Harald Staff Writar
 ","Anderson Delco-Remy workers turned off their machines
and walked off the job at 2 p.m. Monday ina strike over local con-
tract issues.

The 12,700 members of the United Auto Workers Local 662
taking part in the walkout account for approximately 25 per cent
of Madison County’s total work force.
 SPOKESMEN FOR Delco-Remy said
the planned exodus from the plants was
calm and orderly. Some reports
indicated employes in certain areas
jumped the gun and left before the
legitimate strike deadline. However,
company spokesmen explained
staggered time schedules at the various
plants, in which some are 40 minutes
ahead of regular time, probably
accounted for the reports.

The strike came at the last hour of
the first shift which usually ends at
3:30 p.m. Parking lots at the plants
emptied quickly, leaving only the cars
of salaried employes, and pickets
immediately set up lines at 35 plant
gates. Many busied themselves
unpacking lawn chairs to make the
vigil more comfortable.

Asked how it felt to be on strike, one
union member at the entrance to Delco
offices in Plant 1 responded,
“Wonderful!’’ He said he hoped the
strike would last just long enough for
negotiators to reach a fair and just
settlement.

LOCAL 662 president Robert Kinerk
said so far pickets are instructed to
allow management personnel to enter
and leave the plants. He indicated
there may have been some problems
where company people were refused
passage because they did not have
proper identification badges.

News media attempting to enter
Plant 1 shortly after the strike began
were barred by some of the picketers,
but Delco spokemen Charles Hardy and
Ronald Actis came out on the front
lawn to speak to reporters.

Actis said the total employment at
the Anderson plants is 15,500. About
3,000 of those are salaried personnel.
He noted the total payroll here runs
approximately $1 million a Gay.

COMMENTING ON THE possible
effect of the strike here, Hardy said,
‘We have several! assembly plants
down now for model changeover. We
are trying to evaluate what our
customers’ problems are, so it’s pretty
hard to judge the impact of the strike.
But, obviously,” he continued, “if it
goes for any length of time, it would
seriously cripple General Motors’
production as well as the production of
a number of our outside customers,
such as International Harvester,
Cummins and others in the truck and
farm tractor industry.”

Hardy said he could not estimate the
size of the present back supply of parts,
but indicated the company had been
stockpiling through overtime work.

The UAW International office issued
permission for the strike 10 days ago
when it became clear negotiators were
making little progress on at least six
important local contract issues.

EMPLOYES HAVE BEEN working
under an extension of the 1974 local
contract which expired on Sept. 14,
1976. Hardy said negotiations on a new
contract actually began in July, 1976.
At that time, the union presented the
company with what Delco spokesmen
called ‘‘a mountain of demands and
grievances.’

The major issue, acknowledged by
both the union and company, is the
increase of rates and standards on
production lines at plants 3, 8, 10, 11,
and 17.

The company said some of the
disputes over work standards have
come from lines where new equipment
has been installed which increases
production but does not violate any
agreements with the union.

HOWEVER, UNION officials
disagree. ‘That's what they claim,”
said Kinerk, ‘‘but we dispute it. We say
there have not been new processes in
those situations where we've got
grievances.’ He noted the union was
not objecting to some rate increases,
but in other instances the company
“has come in and made some minor
adjustments which, in fact, have made
the job more difficult.’

Delco-Remy has publicly denied
responsibility for a seniority issue in
which the union says the existing
contract has been violated.

The union has said management is
placing new hirees on classified jobs
which should normally go to higher
seniority workers. However, the
company maintains it is following
changes in the new national GM-UAW
agreement which affect local practices.

A THIRD ISSUE, the union indicated,
is the return of employes to work after
an extended illness. ‘‘The problem here
is with people who have been on
extended sick leave,’’ Kinerk
explained. ‘‘Their doctors say they are
ready to come back to work, but
management is stalling their return.”
Other issues reportedly concern
inadequacies in the promotional
procedure, abandonment of
long-established practices in relief ime

cio Batista’s army held Cuba un-
der strict military rule today aft-
er an anti-Batista demonstration
in the prorebel city of Santiago de
Cuba.

Comments on the demonstra-
tion and the situation in Cuba by
Eatl E. T. Smith, the new U.S.
ambassador, brought a fusillade
‘of criticism from political leaders
loyal to the President.

Batista’s Cabinet suspended con-
stitutional guarantees for 45 days
aud immediately directed _ the
army to take control of Santiago,
capital of Oriente province and
a hotbed of anti-Batista  senti-
ment.

A general strike had been called
in the city to protest police ac-
tion in dispersing Wednesday's
demesstration. Most places of
business were closed, although po-
lice forced some food stores to
reopen. Port operations were halt-
ed and banks were shut down.

‘A cafe. near Santiago that had
remained open was hit by gun-
fire and hand grenades hurled
from two automobiles last night.

Army reinforcements also
were reported sent to Bueycito,
another town in Oriente province,
where a band of rebels was said
fo have burned an army post.

Censorship again was clamped
en local and incoming foreign
Sewspapers and radio stations
and on outgoing news dispatches.
Stories sent abroad wre being de-
layed as much as six hours.

Specifically banned was publi-
cation or transmission of news
implying support for the rebels
led by Fidel Castro, Also banned

moted by labor unions or employ-
ers.

Full constitutional guarantees
had been sestored to Cuba's six
‘million people April 15 after a 45-
day suspension. Yesterday's new
decree was the fourth time that
constitutional rights have been
lifted since Castro and a band of
followers landed in eastern Cuba
Jast Dec. 2 and launched # guer-
Tila campaign against the gov-
ernment.

Smith arrived in Cuba July 25
and the Santiago demonstration
obviously was timed to coincide
to take over as ambassador,

 Smith told a news conference
laler the American people ‘‘are
sad and preoccupied by the politi-
eal uneasiness that has reached
the point of bloodshed in Cuba.”

He said he feared “some per-
sons made use of my presence to
jdemonstrate in protest against
ltheir own government,” and ex-
‘pressed hope that the arrested
women would be freed.

According to one account re-
ported to the Communications
'Munistry, Smith also said, “Any
form of excessive police action ig
Tepugnant to me.”

Batista supporters assailed _ the
ambassador’s Temarks as “im:
proper and imprudent.’”

Sen. Jose Gonzalez Puentes,
leader of the President's National
Progressive party in the Senate,
talked with Batista and later is-
sued a statement saying: “Cubs
rejects and repudiates everything
that could be interference in the
affairs of the Cuban govern:

 ",,"The Supreme Court the other day spoke
negatively in the cases of John Howard
Lawson and Dalton Trumbo, film writers
who insisted that becaused of the Consti-
tution they didn’t have to tell the com-
mittee on un-American activities
whether they were Communists
or not. Now, it begins to look,  they’il
have to pay their fines and serve their
terms. But what effect will it have on
other film writers who’ve been flirting
with the Communist cause? Will they
consider the ideology too unpopular to
toy with?

During the war years when Russia was
looked on as a worthy ally, we were to!-
erant of the Communists in America. It
never occurred to us that one of our
allies would maintain a vast spy system
in our country. But with the advent of
the cold war, attitudes have changed. Not
only do we not trust Russia, but we have
found that all during the war she was en-
gaging in questionable activities. Is it any
wonder, then, that even those who are
only suspect would be ostracized? For
can we afford to have puppets who'll do
the bidding of Moscow in high public or
private offices?

In none of the cases was it proved thet
the film writers held membership in the
party. On constitutional grounds, they
simply refused to answer questions. But
that Constitution guarantees other things
besides freedom of speech. It proscribes
activities calculated to overthrow the
government, styling them treason. And
the mere fact that a man is a Communist,
that he’s subject to orders from Moscow,
is evidence in itself to show that hes
dangerous. Until they prove otherwise,
the film writers will be looked on in that
light.

action. Picked nazi troops are sent into Hungary and a
portion of Rumania to take charge of affairs and try to
close the ring of steel around Hitler’s European
fortress.

This step has been planned by nazi leaders for some
time. It certainly is not unexpected. As he did on
many other occasions, Hitler has taken over. His army
is in charge in Hungary and he'll go through the mo-
tions of establishing a puppet government. Hungary
will be sacrificed more and more in the nazi war
effort.

This advance into Hungary is a serious matter for
the allied nations. Hitler’s armies will be well forti-
fied behind the Carpathian mountain range—an excel-
lent natural defense barrier. And with his army in
the new position, Hitler hopes to protect the oil fields
that are providing about one-third of the amount
needed by his war machine.

Hope at this moment for revolt by the people
of Hungary is remote. They have long been under
German domination and their armies have been under
nazi control. They have been bled white just as have
the other nations under nazi influence. They’re caught
between the two fires with little chance for action.

But the day will come, and it’s not too far away
either, when many of these people will rise up to help
the allied cause and Hitler will wonder what hit him.

The only trouble is that it can’t come soon enough.

from the rival Teamsters and United Farm Workers
unions clashed on the picket lines Saturday in the wor-

strike April 16, sheriff's deputies said.

“It was a mad melee of fights and beatings all over
the fields,’’ said Sheriff's Sgt. Dennis Froemming.

Eleven persons were arrested on charges ranging
from disturbing the peace to felony assault, deputies
said. Those arrested included six Teamsters and five
United Farm Workers, they said.

Raymond R. Surowy, 28, of Bell, Calif., a Teamster
and Pedro Hernandez Gutierrez, 20, a United Farm
Worker of Coachella, were booked for investigation of
felony assault, deputies said. Both were released on
$2,500 bail.

Deputies said 25 to 30 persons suffered injuries,
mostly minor.
 The most serious injuries were suffered by two UFW
supporters, Roy Trevino, 18, and Jesus Tamayo, 53,
both of Coachella. Both received head cuts, authorities
said, and were treated at a hospital and released in
good condition.

Trevino was arrested Friday for investigaion of
assault with a deadly weapon when he allegedly tried
to run over some Teamsters with his auto, deputies
said.

The Teamsters and UFW are longtime enemies in
the battle to represent the nation’s farm workers.

The UFW, under the leadership of Cesar Chavez.
called a strike last April after most of the table grape
growers in the rich Coachella Valley signed contracts
with the Teamsters rather than renew their pacts with
the UFW.

There have been periodic clashes between the two
unions here ever since. Teamsters were brought in to
guard against pickets entering the fields.

In a certain theater in Ohio the dressing
rooms are named for states instead of being num-
ered: This saves trouble with superstitious ac-
tors who shy at 13 or who have favorite numbers
to match their names. _ The star dressing room is
naturally named for the home state. A Chinese
star, the Honorable Wu, appeared with his com-
pany and was given the room of honor. He
paused at its threshold and refused to enter.
*Q-hi-o,” it seems, is the Japanese for “Good-
morning” and under the present circurgstances
the Chinese felt he could not possibly dress in a
Japanese dressing room.

How did the manager solve the difficulty?
Very simply. “Let him dress in Illinois or any-
where he wants. Stars are entitled to tempera-
ment.”

These international friendships do call for
asiute diplomacy. It_is perhaps fortunate that
the next-best dressing room did not have a state
name which meant in Chinese “Good-night”.

On March
 ",,"BOSTON (AP) — Demon-
Strators protested forced
school busing by marching
3.000 strong through South
Boston. and mounting a
325-car motorcade to the
suburban home of the judge
“who ordered racial balance
in the city's classrooms.

School officiais said a boy-
cott in conjunction with a
national antibusing protest
‘kept almost 70 per cent of
Boston's white pupils out of
class Friday.

And while 7) per cent of
the black. pupils went ta
school, officials ordered
hundreds of black pupils
bused out. of six South Boston
schools ahead of schedule
Friday. fur fear of confronta-
tion with the antibusing
marchers.

About 500 chanting dernon-
strators went to the home of
U.S. District Court Judge W.
Arthuc Garrity Jr. on Friday
night. The group paraded
peacefully outside his
Wellesley home.

Warlier, autos circled the
block near the judge’s home,
honking -horns and flashing
lights.

The daytime protest
march down Broadway. the
inain street of South Boston,
generally was peaceful. Sev-
eral state legislators, city
councilors and school com-
mittee members led the par-
ade.

South Boston has been a
center of antibusing senti-
ment since schools opened
three weeks ago under an
order by Garrity that
requires the busing of 18,000
pupils. Since then. there has
“been scattered violence and
a partial white boycott of
schools. |

At one point during the
march, white marchers
chased two black men out of
a bar, pelting them with

rocks and cans. About. 100

""whites chased the pair for
three blocks until the black
_ men barricaded themselves
ina building.

A few hours later, police

carrying American flags, started
from NAACP headquarters,

Police blocked the march witt
