has been recommended by more
than 200 Negro leaders who are
requesting employment of Negro
bus drivers and what they call
‘more courteous treatment’’ for

At a meeting last night, the Ne-

pool to provide transporation for
those who depend on buses.

The boycott will last, they said,
until consideration is given a three
point request for Negro drivers,
a first-come-first-served seating
policy on predominantly Negro
routes and for ‘‘more courteous”’
treatment by white drivers for
Negro passengers.

Manager Charles L. Carter of
the Cities Transit Bus Co. said he
has ‘‘no plans to make any chang-
es in company operations and will
continue to operate as in the
past.”

The Tallahassee boycott was
touched off Saturday when two

| Former Protests Future War
— Latter For Spirit Of
Nationalism.
 VIEWS ARE OPPOSITE
 ",,"BERLIN, July 26.—'*Verboten”
was the stern warning issued by
the government today to both the
monarchists and communists to pre-
vent any kind of demonstration In
connection with the 9th anniversary
ef mobilization for the great war.
Roth sides had prepared for activi-
ties, the communists to protest
against future wars and the mon-
archists to attempt to increase the
spirit of nationalism.

It was expected that the present
week would prove the supreme test
of strength between the rival forces.

The government took no chances.
It put the “yerboten” sign upon all
open air gatherings—both mass
metings and parades. The com-
nunist newspaper Rotefahne, in de-
fiance of the government's ‘orders,
urged all radical socialists to come
to Berlin to observe “fascisti day.”

The Rotefahne was not as violent
in tone as usual evidently fearing
suppression by the ‘government if
it exceded the bounds.

Flowever, it went as far as it
could in the way of suggestion to
stir up the masses to revolt. Ina
veiled manner the people were urg-
ed to go to Potsdam on Sunday
to “smoke out the remnants of mon-
archism and militarism from its
stronghold.” ‘

It is feared that if red violence
should break out, a@ slaughter of
unprecedented proportions will fol-
low. That the communists are out
for blood was indicated at Frank-
furt Monday when public prosecu-
tor Haas was seized and dragged
through the streets, sustaining in-
juries which resulted in his death.

The disturbances at Frankfurt is
only a single indication of what is
happening in Germany and of what
is threatened.

Opposite to the communists and
socialists are the German fascisti.
They are just as bitter and as well
prepared as the reds. Their leaders
feel, however, that their best chance
lies in letting the other side start
the battle, then they can intervene
on the plea that they wish to re-
store order. It may be possible to
proclaim a dictatorship as was done
in Italy.

man money was emphasized today

dlue-uniformed policemen, many of
them in tears, arrived by the hun-
dreds Friday to honor their slain
comrade. Another 2,000 persons,
mostly in civilian dress, gathered
outside the Ascension of Our Lord
Roman Catholic Chureh.

The funeral for Patrolman John
Trettin, who was gunned down by
sniper fire Feb. 29, was to take on an
even deeper sadness.

At the end of a brief homily, the
Rt. Rev. Msgr. James Howard
announced that another
Philadelphia‘policeman had died of
a gunshot wound the same morning.
Many of the 1,400 in attendance
gasped openly.

“I'd like to ask you to pause for a
moment and pray for policeman
 James Griffin, who died within the
hour,” said Msgr. Howard.

During the moment of silence that
followed, many policemen were
seen crying and reaching for han-
dkerchiefs in their pockets.

Griffin, 31, was shot Wednesday
night while beoking a theft suspect
at a police station. He died at 9:40
a.m. in Roxborough Memorial
Hospital after his heart stopped
twice during the morning. Though

. critically wounded, there had been
reports his condition was im-
proving.

“This was the largest outpouring
of policemen ever in the city for a
policeman’s funeral,” said Chief
Inspector Richard F. Bridgeford,
who was in charge of the police
arrangements for the funeral.
 He said 230 local and state police
departments from New York City,
Connecticut, New Jersey and
Delaware, in addition to Penn-
sylvania, were there. About 250 cars
joined in a 10-mile procession after
the funeral.

Trettin, 23, was shot in the head
Feb. 25 while investigating reports
someone was firing a rifle in the
area of a Philadelphia housing
project. Three youths have been
charged with the shooting.

Members of the Stakeout Unit, to
which Trettin was assigned, bore his
casket. Patrolman Richard
Malinowski, his partner, was at the
head of the procession.

Trettin’s widow and parents at-
tended the funeral, but the officer's
three young children were not seen.
His widow and mother appeared
near collapse as they left the
church, and had to be helped down
the steps.

Outside, the 90-member Stakeout
Unit lined the steps as the casket
was cartied to a waiting hearse and

 ",,"ENFIELD — Approximately 250 students, parents,
and teachers demonstrated in front of Town Hall
yesterday evening to protest education budget cuts
made bv the Town Council.
 Carrying signs reading ‘Help
educate future taxpayers,”’ “‘$0$
— Save Our Schools,”’ and ‘‘Give
us money or give us stupidity,”’
the demonstrators were serious
and quiet, being watched over by
previously designated marshals
and a police patrolman. Police
Chief Walter Skower said the
marchers were perfectly orderly.

But inside the Council cham-
bers, the reserve of the
demonstrators disappeared,
replaced by bursts of applause
 and floor stomping, impassioned
speeches, and, later on in the
session, the exchange of harsh
words.

The meeting of the Council,
which had nothing on the
published agenda concerning
education, turned into a public
hearing on the budget cuts,
lasting well over an hour.

Mayor Frank Mancuso,
however, made it clear to the
speakers that their concern over
the $1.2-million reduction in the
 school board’s requested budget
was “‘a little bit too late.”

“In the future,”” the mayor
said, ‘“‘you will do well to know
your charter,”’ referring to the
fact that the original public
hearing on the town’s 1972-73
budget was poorly attended.
Mancuso added that there were
only 54 speakers at the budget
hearing, held April 24.

The mayor, however, thanked
the demonstrators for their
conduct, although later in the
evening the situation was to
become much more heated.
Mancuso said the Council would
be willing to listen to their
arguments.
 The statements made before
the Council were hardly all anti-
cut, but contained suggestions
that varied from a referendum to
restore the budget cuts to a call
for the ousting of Board of
Education members and school
officials.

Speaking for a committee of
parents who began organizing
the protest, Carl Sgamboti of 166
Brainard Road told the Council
“‘we are not radicals, but rather
quiet, conservative, law-abiding
citizens and it usually takes a lot
to make us move.”’

He added that the Council’s cut
decision ‘‘has provided the
needed impetus.”
 Sgamboti then listed 12
recommendations, including
general items such as providing
“a reasonable education,’’ and
specific items, such as improving
the school system’s
psychological testing program
and the counselor-student ratio,
providing adequate library
facilities and materials
throughout the schools, providing
a wide range of course offerings
in secondary schools to eliminate
excessive study halls, providing
sufficient funds for music, arts
and other related programs,

be stationed in the halls and

Broke Up Groups
When violence broke out
anew Wednesday night, police
barricaded a 24-block stretch
and ordered a 10 p.m. curfew.
A wedge of 60 shotgun-carrying
patrolmen moved down the
business street, breaking up
groups of milling Negroes.

Police said 27 persons were
arrested on charges of arson,
earrying concealed weapons,
possession of molotov cocktails
and disturbing the peace.

City officials said hundreds of
windows were smashed and a
large number of incendiary
fires set.

At one point, detectives
swooped down on four men who
were making molotov cocktails
in the rear of an elementary
school. Police said they had
cans of gasoline and over 100
bottles. Eight bottles had
already been converted into fire
bombs.

Blamed On Boycott

The incident at the predomin-
antly Negro school was blamed
by school officials on a student
boycott called by an Ad Hoc
committee to protest alleged de
facto segregation.

When classes were dismissed
early, youths invaded the
school.

One of the teachers hurt, Dan

down a hall when he noticed

Russia attacked Western Europe,
‘iL means war'.”’ I marvelled
that he felt it necessary to tell us
any such thing.

Does he really think that any-
one in the United States is so ob-
livious to what happens -in the
world that he does not know that if
Russia attacks Western Europe, it
means war?

Does he think that the people
of our country pay so little at-

that they have already forgotten
‘that Congress ratified a North At-
jlantic Pact and that that treaty
obligates all nations that ratified

It is subtly a defeatist’s way of
approaching and handling the

within itself more power than any
Single aggressor nation or group

possible with voluntary aid to have
enough force to withstand those
overwhelming numbers who serve

will not last forever,

gency service to help handle thou-
sands of commuting war workers,
the leaders of London's striking bus
drivers today were reported facing
the threat of government prosecu-
tion in a drastic move to end the
capital's worst transportation tleup
in seven years...

More than 2,000 drivers were-esti-
mated to be on strike in protest
against thelr new summer schedules.
Although 300 of them voted early
this morning,to return to work im-
mediately, in other localities the
strike appeared to be gaining
strength.

Five hundred employes at the
Manchester gas works went on
strike in a dispute over two cents
an hour on their salaries, and serv-
ice to the city’s 220,000 gas-burning
homes was cut off at once. Wat
industries also were seriously threat-

ened by this new outbreak of work-

stoppage.
Asa result, the political cor-

' respondent of the Daily Expres:
predicted that the government wil
move against the ringleaders unde
the terms of the recently-imposec
anti-strike law, which provides jai
terms and heavy fines for agitating
labor disturbances in key indus:
tries.

Some Fordham University
students wielded lead pipes to
turn back unarmed campus
guards, then ended a sit-in
Wednesday night before New
York City police arrived. Four-
teen guards were injured, police
said

Elsewhere, protesters flew the
Viet Cong flag at the Milwaukee
campus of the University of
Wisconsin and a group of
Princeton University students
tried unsuccessfully to blockade
4 building.

At Fordham, about % stu-
dents seized administrative of.-
fices in mid afternoon to protest
the school’s Reserve Officer
Training Corps program. About
half left, but 3% vowed to stay
all night.

Unarmed campus police tried

broken furniture and overturned
file cabinets. Some of the stu-
dents hit them with lead pipes
and threw hot water.

After the guards retreated
and city police were asked to
help, the protesters broke two
windows and scattered across
the campus. Six were arrested.

The 14 injured guards were
taken to several Bronx hospi-
tals. Police said two of the inju-

A university spokesman esti-
mated the damage at “thou-
sands and thousands of dol-
lars.” He said students did not
try to break into the files.

Fordham has 12,000 students,
5,000 of them undergraduates.

Last month, a referendum on
the ROTC program found 53 per
cent of the students participat-

Current voluntary status.

At the Milwaukee campus of
the University of Wisconsin,
several dozen persons behind a
Viet Cong flag tried to take over
the ROTC office. Nine of them

before 15 ROTC cadets barri-

The nine were arrested by
Milwaukee police, Seven of
them, including an associate
history professor, James D.
Cockcroft, and three nonstu-
dents, were charged with mis
conduct in a public place. The
other two were charged with
hitting and kicking a campus

guard.

At Princeton University in
New Jersey, about 100 under-
graduates, some of them mem-
bers of Students for a Demo-
cratic Society, failed in a block-
ade of the Institute for Defense
Analyses. No violence was re-
ported.

The protesters left the IDA,
which does research for the
Pentagon, and went to Presi-

where they heckled and cursed
him when he said, “This univer-
sity has a contract with IDA

Hundreds of white pupils still boy-
cotted two schools in Alabama to-
day, but thousands of others went
to class with Negroes with no vis-
ible signs of protest.

Attendance was far below nor
mal at West End High in Birming-
ham and the one formerly white
schoo] at Tuskegee, but it was
nearly normal in seven other
schools where racial barriers
came down.

And at West End, the boycott
appeared to be less severe than
it was Tuesday.

Unlike the  scuffling which
brought the arrest of nine white
men at West End Tuesday, the
first day of integrated classes, no
disorders were reported this
morning.

Several hundred pupils gathered
on the lawn of a home near West
End after police stopped them
from assembling on the football
field. White pickets tried to dem-.
onstrate in front of the school, but
police drove them off.

The Birmingham Schoo! Board
said 350 pupils, including two Ne-
gro girls, answered roil call at
West End. Tuesday's attendance
was 575, but ail except about 200
Jeft during the day. :

Thus, the net attendance today
was greater.

At Ramsay High and Graymont
Elementary in Birmingham, it
 was about the same as Tuesday.

But at Tuskecee, where 13 Ne.
Sroes were registered, only 4
score of pupils answered the roll
call out of a normal attendance
of 550, Some of the absent pupils
signed up for a newly started
private school,

was quiet following a mild dem-
onstration Tuesday.

Federalized National Guardsmen
at Birmingham were on a stand-
by, reacy to go on school prop.
erty only if asked by city and
school officials.

No major crowds congregated
on the grounds of West End High.
where hundreds of white pupils
and some adult demonstrators
created disorders Tuesday which
brought nine arresis,

The two Negro pupils entered
 West End half an hour before
class time. Police required white
beys and girls to either enter the
building or leave the vicinity,

About 200 white pupils massed
in a yard near the school. They
attempted first to congregate on
the football field but police chased
them away. Adult pickets who
wented to stage a march near the
school were halted by police

A caravan of cars rolled by the
schoo! but nolice refused to set
the drivers stop, The cars bore.
Confederate flags and anti-Negro
signs.

All was peaceful at Ramsay
High and Graymont Elementary,
the other integrated city schools.
At Ramsay, a _ police captain
urged pupils: “Please go ino
classes—you'll be _doing me a
favor by doing so. |

At Mobile, there was a mild.
vocal demonstration when two
Negroes went to integrated class-'
es for the second day. The chant-
ing of “We don't want to inte-
grate’ stopped after Charles Will-.
“ox, schoel athletic director, chat

 Polhee told them te go to school
or go home, All but three or four
entered the building.

Enroiiment at West End and
Graymont was off sharply Tues-
cay but nearly normal at
Ramsay.

The Poard of Education said
657 enrolled at Ramsay, 575 at
West End and 116 at Graymont.
Expected enrollment was 900 at
Ramsay, 1,498 at West End and
328 at Graymont.

West End wes the only trouble

spot in integration of schools
at Birmingham, Mobile = and
Tuskegee,
- The Guardsmen, some of them
called up three months ago to en-
force integration at the Universi-

nearly demolished the building and threatened, for a
time, to spread along the wooden areas in the rear
of nearby buildings into a major catastrophe.

The Department received an alert at 12:47, the
height of the noon hour at the restaurant, that there
was a grease fire in the kitchen, When the first
truck arrived at the scene, firemen were unable
to get into the building because of the severity of
the smoke.

A general alarm was sounded immediately, drawing
five pieces of apparatus to the scene and calling Fire
Chief Harold A, Shippey from a luncheon at the Metho-
dist Church,

Sixteen paid firemen and about 10 volunteers battled
to bring the fire under control and keep it from
spreading. Members of the Westport Police Depart-
ment blocked off Main Street to traffic and held back
onwatchers who stood in the rain under awnings and
umbrellas,

HUE, South Vietnam (AP) —
American military equipment
estimated to be worth $100 mill-
jon is strewn like a gigantic junk-
pile along the Hueestuary where
Saigon's defeated armored aud
infantry forces tried to escape
by sea in late March.

This was one of the sights you
see after a trip to Hue from Da
Nang, wherea spokesman of the
new Revolutionary Government
said earlier that 103,000 of the
enlisted men and noncommis
sioned officers of the old Army
of the Republic of Vietnam
CARVN) who had been taken
prisoner had already been
released to return to their
homes,

Some former war prisoners
were seen in the areas around

Hue working now in the rice
fields.

From the watchtower of the
former ARVN base here, you
can see about 600 burned out
wehicles in just one of the groups
of abandoned equipment scal-
tered for miles along the estuary
and along the lateral highway
connecting Hue with Tan My
Harbor leading to the South
China Sea.

Former drivers and

 

 
 regiments now are working
under Revolutionary Govern-
ment army officers’ supervision
in getting tanks, armored cars,
trucks and other vehicles runn-
ing again.

Looking dawn the open turrets
af four United Statesdmade M48
tanks, abandoned on the edge of
thehighway, youcan see a dozen
or more rounds of 105mm how-
itzer shells surrounding the gun-
ner's position in each tank. OFT
in a field, a repair crew has just
started up the engine of one sal-
vaged M48 to haul two other
M48s to the highway for further
repairs,

Some captured M48s still have
“United Slates Army"" painted
in white on the body of the tank
above the tracks. The dirt shoul-
ders of the highway are covered
in parts with belts of .50-caliber
machine gun ammunition, hand
arenades, artillery shells still in
the original packing and a mis-
cellany of ather items,

Across the highway from the
farmer ARVN supply base,
where the retreat hecame a
light on beats down to ships
waiting al sea, are three modern
communications centers with
high transmission antennac
built by the Americans. Out-
wardly they look undamaged.

On the bank, Revolutionary
Government forces are salvag-
ing steel pontoons and steel
bridging. Equipment left behind
seems in almost mint condition.

A revolutionary army officer
lat the captured supply base said
that of a total of 3,000 ARVN
military vehicles icft along the
estuary, mare than 200 were
sunk, mast of them self-
propelled guns and armored
cars. He added thal 60 of the M48
tanks which fell into his army's
hands have since been piven a
clean up and sent south with the
National Liberation Forces,

He said six self-propelled
170mm long-range artillery
pieces were in booty here. He
said four are naw incombatcon-
dition and with liberation forces
in the South.

Driving to Hue over Hai Yan
(Sea Cloud) Pass from Ja Nang,
this carrespondent noted that
heavy sauthbound military traf-
fic was a formidable obstacle for
most of the 60 miles on Highway
One. Interspersed with Soviet
made armor were occasional
tanks from-the ARVN’s big
American stares.

In military truck convoys
thereswasa unique mix of Soviet,
Chinese and American vehicles

It was an eerie feeling to walk
on graund where the ARVN
made a desperate concentration
March 23 for a Vietnamese Dun-
kirk. That was three days before
Hue, once Vietnam’s imperial
capital, fell to the revolutionary
forces. Lots of equipment was
hurned by retreating ARVN sol-
iera. But a considerable amount
was not.

Walking across the former
area base packed with blac-
kened hulks of American-made
armor, yau step carefully, The
concrete paving is littered with
ammunition, rackets, grenades,
some of it still live,

A fire engine is burned out but
its fire hose nozzles of stainless
steel glisten brightly. Typewri
ters, portable radio transmit-
ters, cans of turkey lnaf rations
bayonets, steel helmets, gas
masks, mess kits, filing
cabinets, shovels,
machineguns, motorcycles, and
even a television set lie in the
ashes.

Between this Dunkirk-like
scene and Hue itself, thousands
of acres of rice are being far-
vested. Teams of seven or eight
young men are cutting rice
stalks and tying them in
sheaves. The young men are
dressed in green military tunics
and shorts.

Through an interpreter, the
leader of one of these teams said
he and his men came from a
nearby village, all having
served at one time or another in
the ARVN. Some had served
until very recently, he added.

He said he was a driver in 2
unit of the ARVN engineers for
eight years, had been involved
in a traffic accident with an
acmy truck and was put in jai
for it. He was in jail when the
liberation forces arrived in Hut
and liberated him, he said,

The liberation forces let him
go home to become a farmer
again. The fact that he anc
others engaged in the harvest
were in military tunics and
shorts did not mean they wert
in any armed forces now, he
said. It was, he added, because
these clothes were the cheapes!
they could buy,

He said the land on which his
team was working belonged
communally to his village.

 ","JAMES THRASHER
NEA Serrice Writer
 ","Do women dress to please themselves? Or
other women? Or men?

Until recently, the answer was anybody’s
guess. Almost everybody did' guess, and the ques-
tion was handy for usually good-natured debate
when other topics palled.

But time marches on, Frenchmen experiment,
science finds answers to the deepest mysteries, and
now—tentatively, with an eye on the nearest exit
—we can suggest an answer. r 4

Up to a certain age, say seventeen or eighteen,
girls dress to resemble every other girl so that they
won’t seem odd, different, old-fashioned, unin-
formed or economically underprivileged.

At that certain age, which varies slightly,
girls discover boys. It dawns upon Jill that both
her greatest pleasure and her social standing de-
pend upon being attractive to boys.

x oe

Then is when the girl, now a woman, stops
dressing for other girls and begins dressing for the
boys, now, in her eyes at least, men. This she
probably will continue to do until she reaches an.
age it would be unchivalrous to discuss, at which
time she can begin dressing for comfort.

This answer gains confirmation from what is
happening since French designers tried to force
new styles on American women, with longer skirts,
false hips, bustles, doodads, thingamajigs and a:
wide variety of petites machines here and there.

Figuring that women would rave over the first
style change since the war began, stores cut-priced.

‘their old stocks, cleaned them out, and took what.
one buyer calls “the worst shellacking since the
short skirt came in in 1925.” They stocked up
with new styles and waited for customers.

They’re still waiting. You'll see models, and
some extremists, wearing what Paris ordered.
You'll find it on high school wpper-classwomen and
college freshmen and sophomores, while Daddy sits
home massaging his aching checkbook. But that’s
about all. ‘

The average older girl and woman is staying.
away from dress shops until she is driven there,
and then she picks the closest she can find to the
styles Paris tried to take from her.

. x se *

Why? Because the new styles are, according
to Miss Ethel Traphagen of the Traphagen School
of Fashion, un-American? Because they are re-
actions to what we laugh at in pictures from the
Gay Nineties? Because they demand excess ma-
terial in a time of scarcity?

Maybe, a little. But what veally matters is
those trim legs, those tidy waists, those smooth
hips the gals have spent years developing. With
all their faults, no other country can show their
like. . American women are proud of them. Ameri-
can men like to keep an eye on them, °

Even if money were no object, our men still
prefer skirts “just a little below the knee” when
standing, and while we'll concede padded shoulders,
we want hips streamlined.

American men prefer American styles. Amer-
ican women like American men. The stores will
ell some Paris grotesqueries to some women, in-
cluding those who “just haven’t a thing to wear.”

But the reluctance with which women are buy-
ing, once they achieve the age of awareness to-
ward men, buttresses the argument of us who long
have contended that if a choice must be made, wo-
nien will dréss as men like them to.

A military spokesman in Tel

killed six Egyptian soldiers in
two flareups along the shaky

in Cairo government sources
‘said Egypt had redeployed its
troops along the west bank of
the Suez Canal to drive the
Israelis back behind the Oct. 22
cease-fire line, if necessary.

The sudden tension along the
canal came as Israeli Premier
‘Golda Meir was in Washington

and Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger. Egyptian Foreign
Minister Ismail Fahmi also was
in Washington but there was no
indication the Egyptian and
Israeli leaders would meet.

said President Anwar Sadat
will order a military offensive
only as a last resort and failing
a voluntary pull-back by Israeli
forces on the Egyptian main-
land, He threatened Wednesday
to resume the war if the
Israelis do not withdraw.

Egypt has made the start of
peace talks and the release of
war prisoners contingent upon
an Israeli withdrawal, and
Sadat reaffirmed that position
Wednesday. Israel has asked an
immediate exchange of POWs

continued its advance after the
Oct. 22 cease-fire and encircled
Suez City, cutting it off from
the rest of Egypt. Israel said it,
