r"""
Terminal rendering.

``render_root`` is responsible for generating ansi from the diffs of the root's double
buffer. Ansi is generated in a bit of a naive way, where the cursor is moved to specific
coordinate then all sgr parameters of the cell is output, for each cell in the diff.
This generates a lot of ansi for large diffs. In the future, this function might decide
to try and output as little ansi as possible, if there is a noticable performance gain
to do so.
