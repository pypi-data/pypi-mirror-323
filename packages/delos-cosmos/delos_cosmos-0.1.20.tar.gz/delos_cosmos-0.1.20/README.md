# Delos Cosmos

## Cosmos client for interacting with the Cosmos API.

# Installation

To install the package, use `poetry`:

```bash
poetry add delos-cosmos
```

Or if you use the default `pip`:

```bash
pip install delos-cosmos
```

# Client Initialization

You can create an **API key** to access all services through the **Dashboard** in **CosmosPlatform**
`https://platform.cosmos-suite.ai`.

![API Key creation in Cosmos Platform](https://i.ibb.co/6mvm1hQ/api-key-create.png)

To create a `Cosmos` client instance, you need to initialize it with your API key:

```python
from cosmos import CosmosClient

client = CosmosClient("your-api-key")

```

# Endpoints

This `delos-cosmos` client provides access to the following endpoints:

**Status Endpoints**

- `status_health_request`: Check the health of the server.

**Translate Endpoints**

- `translate_text_request`: Translate text.
- `translate_file_request`: Translate a file.

**Web Endpoints**

- `web_search_request`: Perform a web search.

**LLM Endpoints**

- `chat`: Chat with the LLM.
- `embed`: Embed data into the LLM.

**Files Endpoints**

A **single file** can be read and parsed with the universal parser endpoint:

- `files_parse_request`: Parse a file to extract the pages, chunks or subchunks.

An **index** groups a set of files in order to be able to query them using natural language. There are several
operations regarding **index management**:

- `files_index_create_request`: Create an index.
- `files_index_add_files_request`: Add files to an index.
- `files_index_delete_files_request`: Delete files from an index.
- `files_index_delete_request`: Delete an index.
- `files_index_restore_request`: Restore a deleted index.
- `files_index_rename_request`: Rename an index.

And regarding **index querying**

- `files_index_ask_request`: Ask a question about the index documents (it requires that your `index.status.vectorized`
  is set to `True`).
- `files_index_embed_request`: Embed or vectorize the index contents.
- `files_index_list_request`: List all indexes.
- `files_index_details_request`: Get details of an index.

These endpoints are accessible through `cosmos` client methods.

> ℹ️ **Info:** For all the **endpoints**, there are specific **parameters** that are required regarding the data to be
> sent to the API.
>
> Endpoints may expect `text` or `files` to operate with, the `output_language` for your result, the `index_uuid` that
> identifies the set of documents, the `model` to use for the LLM operations, etc.
>
> You can find the standardized parameters like the `return_type` for file translation and the `extract_type` for file
> parser in the appropiate endpoint.

---

## Status Endpoints

### Status Health Request

To **check the health** of the server and the validity of your API key:

```python
response = client.status_health_request()
if response:
    print(f"Response: {response}")
```

---

## Translate Endpoints

### 1. Translate Text Request

To **translate text**, you can use the `translate_text_request` method:

```python
response = client.translate_text_request(
                        text="Hello, world!",
                        output_language="fr"
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Translated Text: {response}")
```

### 2. Translate File Request

To **translate a file**, use the `translate_file_request` method:

```python
local_filepath_1 = Path("/path/to/file1.pdf")

response = client.translate_file_request(
                        filepath=local_filepath_1,
                        output_language="fr",
                    )
```

According to the type of file translation you prefer, you can choose the `return_type` parameter to:

| return_type        |                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| raw_text `Default` | Returns the translated text only                    |
| url                | Return the translated file with its layout as a URL |
| file               | Returns a FastaAPI FileResponse type                |

> 💡 **Tip:** For faster and economical translations, set the `return_type` to `raw_text` to request to translate only
> the **text content**, without the file layout.

```python
local_filepath_1 = Path("/path/to/file1.pdf")
local_filepath_2 = Path("/path/to/file2.pdf")

# Set return_type='raw_text' -> only the translated text will be returned:
response = client.translate_file_request(
                        filepath=local_filepath_1,
                        output_language="fr",
                        return_type="raw_text"
                    )

# or return_type='url' -> returns a link to translated file with original file's layout:
response = client.translate_file_request(
                        filepath=local_filepath_2,
                        output_language="fr",
                        return_type="url"
                    )

if response:
    print(f"Translated File Response: {response}")
```

---

## Web Endpoints

### Web Search Request

To perform a **web search**:

```python
response = client.web_search_request(text="What is the capital of France?")

# Or, if you want to specify the output_language and filter results
response = client.web_search_request(
                        text="What is the capital of France?",
                        output_language="fr",
                        desired_urls=["wikipedia.fr"]
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Search Results: {response}")
```

---

## LLM Endpoints

LLM Endpoints provide a way to interact with several Large Language Models and Embedders in an unified way. Currently
supported `model`s are:

| Chat Models               | Embedding Models     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| _gpt-3.5_ `Legacy`        | **ada-v2** `Default` |
| gpt-4-turbo               |                      |
| gpt-4o                    |                      |
| **gpt-4o-mini** `Default` |                      |
| command-r                 |                      |
| command-r-plus            |                      |
| llama-3-70b-instruct      |                      |
| mistral-large             |                      |
| mistral-small             |                      |

### 1. Chat Request

To **chat** with the LLM:

```python
response = client.llm_chat_request(text="Hello, how are you?")

# Default model is handled, so that request is equivalent to:
response = client.llm_chat_request(
                        text="Hello, how are you?",
                        model="gpt-4o-mini"
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Chat Response: {response}")
```

### 2. Embed Request

To **embed** some text using a LLM:

```python
response = client.llm_embed_request(text="Hello, how are you?")
if response:
    print(f"Embed Response: {response}")
```

---

## Files Endpoints

### Universal Reader and Parser

The Universal reader and parser allows to open many textual **file** formats and extract the content in a **standarized
structure**. In order to parse a file:

```python
local_filepath_1 = Path("/path/to/file1.docx")
local_filepath_2 = Path("/path/to/file2.pdf")

response = client.files_parse_request(filepath=local_filepath_1)

if response:
    print(f"Parsed File Response: {response}")
```

Previous request can be further contolled by providing the **optional parameters**:

```python
response = client.files_parse_request(
                        filepath=local_filepath_1,
                        extract_type=chunks,
                        k_min=500,
                        k_max=1000,
                        overlap=0,
                        filter_pages="[1,2]", # subset of pages to select
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Parsed File Response: {response}")
```

| return_type      |                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| chunks `Default` | Returns the chunks of the file. You can custom its tokens size by setting `k_min`, `k_max`, `overlap`      |
| subchunks        | Returns the subchunks of the file (minimal blocks in the file, usually containing around 20 or 30 tokens). |
| pages            | Returns the content of the file parsed as pages                                                            |
| file             | Returns the the whole file contents                                                                        |

> 💡 **Tip:** When using `extract_type=chunks`, you can define the `k_min`, `k_max` and `overlap` parameters to control
> the size of the chunks. Default values are `k_min=500`, `k_max=1200`, and `overlap=0`.

### Files Index

Index group a set of files in order to be able to query them using natural language. The **Index attributes** are:

| Attributes | Meaning                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| index_uuid | Unique identifier of the index. It is randomly generated when the index is created and cannot be altered.                                      |
| name       | Human-friendly name for the index, can be modified through the `rename_index` endpoint.                                                        |
| created_at | Creation date                                                                                                                                  |
| updated_at | Last operation performed in index                                                                                                              |
| expires_at | Expiration date of the index. It will only be set once the `delete_index` request is explictly performed. (Default: None)                      |
| status     | Status of the index. It will be `active`, and only when programmed for deletion it will be `countdown` (2h timeout before effective deletion). |
| vectorized | Boolean status of the index. When `True`, the index is ready to be queried.                                                                    |
| files      | List of files in the index. Contains their filehash, filename and size                                                                         |
| storage    | Storage details of the index: total size in bytes and MB, number of files.                                                                     |
|            |

The following **Index operations** are available:

- `INDEX_LIST`: List all indexes.
- `INDEX_DETAILS`: Get details of an index.
- `INDEX_CREATE`: Create a new index and parse files.
- `INDEX_ADD_FILES`: Add files to an existing index.
- `INDEX_DELETE_FILES`: Delete files from an index.
- `INDEX_DELETE`: Delete an index. **Warning**: _This is a delayed (2h) operation, allowed to be reverted with
  `INDEX_RESTORE`. After 2h, the index will be **deleted and not recoverable**._
- `INDEX_RESTORE`: Restore a deleted index _(within the 2h after it was marked for deletion)_.
- `INDEX_EMBED`: Embed index contents.
- `INDEX_ASK`: Ask a question to the index. It requires that `INDEX_EMBED` is performed to allow index contents
  querying.

### Files Index Requests

#### 1. Existing Index Overview

To **list all indexes** in your organization, files included and storage details:

```python
response = client.files_index_list_request()
if response:
    print(f"List Indexes Response: {response}")
```

With **get details** of an index you can see the list of files in the index, their filehashes, their size, the `status`
of the index and the `vectorized` boolean status (find more details about the Index fields above):

```python
response = client.files_index_details_request(index_uuid="index-uuid")
if response:
    print(f"Index Details Response: {response}")
```

#### 2. Index Management

To **create a new index** and parse files, provide the list of **filepaths** you want to parse:

```python
local_filepaths = [Path("/path/to/file1.docx"), Path("/path/to/file2.pdf")]

response = client.files_index_create_request(
                        filepaths=local_filepaths,
                        name="Cooking Recipes"
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Index Create Response: {response}")
```

Let's say the new index has been created with the UUID `d55a285b-0a0d-4ba5-a918-857f63bc9063`. This UUID will be used in
the following requests, particularly in the `index_details` whenever some information about the index is needed.

You can **rename the index** with the `rename_index` method:

```python
index_uuid = "d55a285b-0a0d-4ba5-a918-857f63bc9063"
response = client.files_index_rename_request(
                        index_uuid=index_uuid,
                        name="Best Recipes"
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Rename Index Response: {response}")
```

To **add files** to an existing index, provide the list of **filepaths** you want to add:

```python
index_uuid = "d55a285b-0a0d-4ba5-a918-857f63bc9063"
local_filepath_3 = [Path("/path/to/file3.txt")]

response = client.files_index_add_files_request(
                        index_uuid=index_uuid,
                        filepaths=local_filepath_3
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Add Files to Index Response: {response}")
```

To **delete files** from an existing index, specify the **filehashes** of the files you want to delete:

```python
index_uuid = "d55a285b-0a0d-4ba5-a918-857f63bc9063"
filehashes_to_delete = ["2fa92ab4627c199a2827a363469bf4e513c67b758c34d1e316c2968ed68b9634"]

response = client.files_index_delete_files_request(
                        index_uuid=index_uuid,
                        files_hashes=filehashes_to_delete
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Delete Files from Index Response: {response}")
```

To **delete an index** (it will be marked for deletion which will become effective **after 2h**):

```python
response = client.files_index_delete_request(index_uuid="index-to-delete-uuid")
if response:
    print(f"Delete Index Response: {response}")
```

To **restore an index** marked for deletion (only possible during the 2h after the `INDEX_DELETE` was requested):

```python
response = client.files_index_restore_request(index_uuid="index-to-restore-uuid")
if response:
    print(f"Restore Index Response: {response}")
```

#### 3. Index Querying

To **embed** or **vectorize index contents** in order to allow the query operations:

```python
response = client.files_index_embed_request(index_uuid="index-uuid")
if response:
    print(f"Embed Index Response: {response}")
```

To **ask a question** about the index documents (it requires that your `index.status.vectorized` is set to `True`):

```python
response = client.files_index_ask_request(
                        index_uuid="index-uuid",
                        question="What is Cosmos?"
                    )
if response:
    print(f"Ask Index Response: {response}")
```

## Requests Usage and Storage

All request responses show the **number of tokens** and **cost** consumed by the request. The **storage** for index
documents is **limited** up to your organization's quota and is shared between all indexes within your organization.
Contents **do not expire**, but they can be deleted by performing an explicit request through the API endpoints or
through the **CosmosPlatform** at `https://platform.cosmos-suite.ai/`.

In the **CosmosPlatform**, you can monitor the requests performed by your organization with your API Key and the files
stored in the Index Storage.

![API key usage in Cosmos Platform](https://i.ibb.co/VTD35z1/api-key-usage.png)

Through both the native requests towards Cosmos and the Python client, you can handle and delete files directly from the
Cosmos Platform.
