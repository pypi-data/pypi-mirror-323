# QwantAI

QwantAI is a Python library that provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Qwant search engine. You can use it to perform searches and retrieve results either as a single text or streamed data in real time via WebSocket.

---

## Features

- Perform searches on Qwant using a simple Python function.
- Retrieve results in your preferred language.
- Choose between streamed real-time output or a single consolidated response.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into any project.

---

## Installation

Install QwantAI using `pip` (once packaged):

```bash
pip install QwantAI
```

If you're developing locally, clone the repository and install it directly:

```
git clone https://github.com/ramona-flower/QwantAI.git
cd QwantAI
pip install .
```

Usage
Import the package and start searching:

# Non-Streamed Example
- Retrieve all results as a single text response.

```py
import QwantAI

response = QwantAI.search("Python programming", language="en_US", streamed=False)
print(response)
```

# Streamed Example
- Retrieve results in real-time as they are generated.

```py
import QwantAI

QwantAI.search("Python programming", language="en_US", streamed=True)
```

# Parameters
search(query, language="en_US", streamed=False)
