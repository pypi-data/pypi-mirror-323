## Introduction
Welcome to lmfitxps, a small Python package designed as an extension for the popular lmfit package, specifically tailored for X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data analysis.

While lmfit provides simple tools to build complex fitting models for non-linear least-squares problems and applies these models to real data, as well as introduces several built-in models, `lmfitxps` acts as an extension to lmfit designed for XPS data analysis. `lmfitxps` provides a comprehensive set of functions and models that facilitate the fitting of XPS spectra. In particular, lmfitxps provides several models that use the convolution of a Gaussian with model functions of the limit-package.

In addition to models for fitting signals in XPS data, lmfitxps introduces several background models that can be included in the fit model for fitting the data rather than subtracting a precalculated background. This is the so-called active approach, as suggested by A. Herrera-Gomez, and generally leads to better fit results.

For further details, please refer to the documentation of [lmfitxps](https://lmfitxps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/index.html)! 

## Installation
To install `lmfitxps`, simply use pip:
